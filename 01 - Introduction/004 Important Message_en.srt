00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Welcome to Udemy.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I just wanna make sure that you are ready

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to use the tools correctly to maximize learning potential.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So in this course, I will be speaking at my normal speed,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but if you think I am too slow,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
you can speed me up up to 2X.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oppositely, if you think I speak too fast,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you can decrease my speed up to 0.5X.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Also, I've made sure that this course

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
has professional subtitles that you can enable

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
on the bottom right using the CC icon.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Finally, you can also use transcripts

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to read alongside the video if that helps you

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
maximize your learning.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
At some point during the course,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you Udemy will ask you for some feedback.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you are not ready to give a rating yet,

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
click on Ask Me Later.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Else, you can select a star rating for whatever you want

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and then click on the star when you're done.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Here you can leave me a small message

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
telling me what you like about this course

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and what you want me to improve.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
When you're done, click on Save and Continue

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and you can go ahead with this course.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I wanna say, your ratings are super important for me

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and for new students, so please make sure you leave one

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
when your ready, okay?

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's all, I will see you in the next lecture.
