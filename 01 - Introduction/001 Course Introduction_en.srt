1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello and welcome

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
to the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner course.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Stephane Maarek and I will be your instructor.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So we are starting in five minutes,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but please try to pay attention to this lecture.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So we are going to prepare for the Cloud Practitioner exam.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The exam code is CLF-C02.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It is a challenging certification

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so this course is going to be long and interesting

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and it is good if you have some basic IT knowledge,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but don't worry if you don't come from an IT background

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I will explain everything for you as well.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In this course, we're going to learn a lot.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We will cover over 40 AWS services

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
out of the 200 plus that exists in AWS.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you are a beginner in IT and AWS, do not worry.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You are welcome to this course

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and you will learn a lot.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But take your time. It's not a race.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You'll learn a lot every day by doing little by little.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then this course is a bit special,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
because I want you to learn also by doing.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a key learning technique in this course.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So this course will mix both theory lectures

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and where necessary, hands-on where you can follow along

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
with me in the course by creating your own AWS accounts

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and reproducing what I do on screen.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So now we're preparing for a certification.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I want to show you the type

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
of questions you're going to get.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So this is a sample question from the exam

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which says, "Which AWS service would simplify the migration

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
of a database to AWS?"

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It will have four answers,

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Storage Gateway, Database Migration Service,

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
EC2 and Amazon AppStream 2.0.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now this course is going to cover most of the services.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
For example, the first service we will learn in this course.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The second service, the name is obvious,

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
it is the answer to the question.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That is the correct answer

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and we will cover this service as well.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
For EC2, we will learn as well,

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and it is possible in the course you have services

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
that will be called distractors.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So they will not be covered in the course

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
because there are over 200 services in AWS,

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but they will appear at the exam as a wrong answer.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So in this course I want to focus on the service

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that I know are core to AWS

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and that will come up in the exam

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
but it will not focus on explaining you the distractors

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
because that would make too much information into your head.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you're interested into checking out the sample questions

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
for the exam, you can use this link.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So now a little bit about me.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So my name is Stephane Maarek

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and I will be your instructor for this course.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have 11 AWS certifications, so all of them,

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and I've worked with AWS for many years.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've built websites, applications

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
streaming platforms and so on.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I've been teaching for almost seven years on Udemy

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
about AI certifications

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
or services CloudFormation, Lambda and EC2.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
As you can see, I have over 2 million students

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that have went through my courses

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and everyone has been very successful with this course.

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So I'm very happy that you're here

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
following along with me.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So you can connect with me on social media.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You can follow me on LinkedIn, on Instagram, on Medium,

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Twitter and GitHub, and the links are here.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So welcome to AWS.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You are going to get certified

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and you're going to get the first certification in AWS

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
called the Foundational certification

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
for AWS cloud practitioner.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is a great first choice, but this is pretty high level.

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you want to deepen your knowledge

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and get more technical about AWS.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then after this course,

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I would recommend you tackle the Associate certifications.

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Then if you're really an aficionado of AWS

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and want to learn more and more and more, the Specialty exam

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and the Professional exams are really difficult

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and will test your in-depth knowledge.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In this course, we're just going to prepare

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
for the foundational knowledge necessary to pass

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
with flying colors

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
the AWS certified cloud practitioner examination.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Finally, I said we are going to practice in this course.

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So you may have a question,

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
which is how much will this course cost me?

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So this is how much it costs me at the end of this course,

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
$12 and 70 cents.

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But I wanna tell you right away

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
that most of the services we'll use

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
in this course will be within the AWS Free Tier.

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So there is a chance for you to have a cost of zero.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Now, if I use a service

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
in this course that will cost you money, I will mention it

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and I will give you the option to not do the hands-on

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
with me and just watch me do.

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
For example, the most expensive item

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
in here is the registrar because I purchased a domain name.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So a URL, for example, stephaneccp.com.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can read more about the Free Tier at this URL

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
if you're unsure about if something is going

110
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to cost you money or not

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
or you can just come back to the slide

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and then see based on the service we're watching

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
if it's going to cost you anything or not.

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
As I mentioned, most of the services we'll be using

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
will be within the Free Tier, so don't worry there,

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll be guiding you all along the way.

117
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I am super happy that you're here with me in this course

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and I wish you a happy learning.
