00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi and welcome, my name is Stephane Maarek,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and I will be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm delighted to have you here,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I really hope that you will enjoy this course

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and that you will go all the way through with it.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, this is just a two-minute introduction

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so that you get to know me,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and then we'll hop right into the course.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm French, so if you hear a small accent,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
this is where it comes from,

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it's the sweet country of France.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But I've also lived in the United States, in Australia,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and now in Portugal.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My expertise is going to be around AWS certifications

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and Apache Kafka.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why?

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well because in my career,

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I've had the chance to be a data analyst,

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
a big data engineer, a developer, and a solutions architect.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, obviously nowadays I'm a teacher, I love to teach,

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and this is my passion,

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and I'm gonna help you achieve any goals you have

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
through online learning.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So before we get started with this course,

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
there are two ways you can connect with me.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The first place is on LinkedIn.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So this is where I will share some news about AWS

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and the Kafka ecosystem.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is where I announce new courses,

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and this is where I congratulate my students.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, for example, if you've completed the course,

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
or you passed a certification,

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
make a post on LinkedIn and tag me,

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and I will make sure to congratulate you.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I love to see my students reach their goals,

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
this is my main motivation.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The second way is on Instagram.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, Instagram is a big part of mine

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that I've started several years ago.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So I love to travel the world,

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and I dedicate some of my time to actually meet my students.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And to date, I've already met over 40 students.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So every time I meet students,

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
we'll have a chat about your goals,

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
about how the course helped you in your career,

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and just general chat about life.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And at the end of it, I will make a post on Instagram.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So if you want to get the chance to meet me,

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
or to read about other students' stories,

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
then follow me on Instagram.

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Finally, before starting this course,

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I want you to set a goal.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
By setting a goal,

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you will have a much higher chance of finishing this course

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and learning a lot.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So maybe you want to finish this course in three weeks,

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that's perfect.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is how you learn,

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and this is how you will make the most out of this course.

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And don't hesitate to go through the videos

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
as many times as needed.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is what videos are used for.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If necessary, you can speed up the video or slow it down,

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so it becomes easier for you to understand me.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So, that's it for me.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I hope you will enjoy the course,

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Happy learning!

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
(bright music fades)
