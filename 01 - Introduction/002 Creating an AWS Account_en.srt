1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's go ahead and create an AWS accounts.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the first thing you have to do,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is to specify a route user email address

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is your main email address.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And they will be used to log to your Amazon accounts.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
On top of it, you can specify a name for account.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For example, stefane-demo-v3.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
After verifying your accounts,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
you have to set a root user password

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and confirm this root user password.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you lose your root password,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you can recover it,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
thanks to your email, but it is better for you not to forget

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
about your email address and your root user password.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Next, you specify that this is a personal accounts

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and you enter your details for this accounts.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Next, you have to enter credit card details

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and you will get an authorization

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
of $1 onto this credit card.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So this is not a charge, is a pending transaction

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and it's just an authorization that will be canceled.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And as long as you remain within the Free Tier,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
you will not be charged.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But if you go over the Free Tier, then you will be charged.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And I will show you of course

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
how out to monitor for these things.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But if you follow this course,

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
you should remain within the Free Tier limits.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
After that step, you must confirm your identity

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
by providing a phone number and then receiving

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
either SMS or a voice call to confirm that phone number.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then you must choose a support plan

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and will use the basic support free for this course,

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
because that's all we need.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then you complete the signup,

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and congratulations you are signed up for AWS.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It will take a few minutes to activate your account

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and you'll receive an email when this is complete.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
In the meantime, you can click

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
on go to the AWS Management Console.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You must enter your root user email address

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and your password, and then you are logged

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
in into the AWS Console.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Congratulations, let's get started with this course.
