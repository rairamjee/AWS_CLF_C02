1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So we are going to first,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
define a password policy.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For this, click on account settings on the left-hand side.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You will find password policy and you can edit it.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So here, we can use the IAM default password policy,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which composes of these kind of requirements,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
or we can customize the password policy

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and force a password minimum length.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We can also require uppercase letter, lowercase letter,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a number, a non-alphanumeric character.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We can also turn on password expiration to turn on,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
for example, expire after 90 days,

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or that a password expiration

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
requires administrative resets, or we can allow the users

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to change their own password

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
or we can prevent password reuse.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So this password process can be edited directly

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
from the IAM console, and that's the first part of security.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The second part

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
is around setting multi-factor authentication

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
for your root account.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So if you click on the account name

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and then click on security credentials, if you are logged in

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
with the root user,

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you will see my security credentials root user.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now, there is a way for you

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to actually protect your root user,

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which is the most important account in your AWS account,

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and you can protect it by using multi-factor authentication.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now, just so you know, I'm going to do it

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and demonstrate how it works in front of you,

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but I've had students who locked themselves out

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
of their accounts because they lost access

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to their multi-factor authentication device.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
As such, if you think you are running the risk

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of losing your iPhone or whatever, do not do this, okay?

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Just keep your phone with you, just watch my video.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It will be good enough if you want to practice along

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
with me, you can as well.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And you can also delete the MFA device after activating it.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, but let's go ahead and assign an MFA device.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So I will call this one my iPhone

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
because this is what I have, but you can name it

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
whatever you want.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Then you can select the type of MFA device.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So it could be an authenticator app,

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
which is something I'm going to use,

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but also it can be a security key or a hardware TOTP token.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So I'm going to use an authenticator app

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
because it will be virtual.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And now we go into the setup of the app.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So there's a list of compatible applications right here.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You can find here for Android

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and for iOS that we know work well with AWS.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And as such, I'm going to use the Twilio

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
of the Authenticator, which is an app I like.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So what I have to do then is actually launch the app

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
on my phone and then you click on show QR code.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So when you should a QR code, you need

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to scan this QR code directly on your phone.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So for this, you add an account,

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you scan the QR code right here,

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and once scanned, it will add the account

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and start naming it.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So we'll just save this, this looks good.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And then we get access to MFA code.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So there is first, the first MFA code, so 301935.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So this is a code generated by my iPhone in real-time.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And this code is going to change over time.

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And the reason why these two codes are asked by AWS

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
is that it wants to make sure that the MFA device

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
is set up correctly and that the codes are accurate.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So the second code is 792843.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And, of course, there will be difference for your device.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And once these two codes are entered, you click on add MFA.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And as you can see, we can reach there up

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
to eight MFA devices currently, and you can scroll down

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and see them right here on the list.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So the multi-factor authentication, MFA, one,

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
it's called my iPhone that's been created right now.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So if you wanted to remove it, you can remove it and so on.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But so how do we use MFA?

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well now, if I log out of AWS

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and I log back in, so I'm going

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
to use my router account and my password.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Now after doing a successful login,

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I have the MFA code to enter.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And so I open my app

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and enter the code that I see and press submit.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And this way IAM logged in.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And this is perfect because well, we had an extra level

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
of security on our account.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So that's it for this lecture.

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
