1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's practice using roles.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So on the left hand side, you click on roles,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and you can see that some roles may have already

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
been created for your accounts.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Could be two, could be more. It doesn't matter.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But what we're going to do is that we're going to

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
create our own role in here.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So a role is a way to give AWS entities permissions

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to do stuff on AWS.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
As you can see, you have different kind of roles.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You can create actually five of them right now.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But the one that you need to know about for this hands-on

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and for the exam is going to be a role for an AWS service.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So let's choose this one, and then we need to choose

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for which service we want this role to apply to.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So as you can see, if you click on it,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
you have commonly used services, such as EC2 and Lambda,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
or a role for pretty much every service on AWS.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So it's a very common thing to know in AWS,

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and that's why we learn about it.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So we are going to create a role for an EC2 instance

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
when we get to the EC2 section.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And so we choose EC2, and the use case is just EC2.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We disregard any of these.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So click on next, and now that we create a role

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
for an EC2 instance, we need to attach a policy.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So I'm going to attach the IAM read only access

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to allow my EC2 instance to read whatever is in IAM.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's click on next.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Next do meet to enter a demo, a role name,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
so DemoRoleForEC2 is going to be my role name,

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and then we select the trusted entities.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So this is saying, hey, this role can be assumed

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
by the EC2 service, and this is what defines it

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
as a role for Amazon EC2.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We are verifying the permissions,

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
yes, it has IAM read only access,

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and we create this role.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So now my role is created.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
As you can see, it appears in my role lists.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And we can verify that the permissions

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
are correct for this role.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now, we cannot use this role just yet

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
because we need to get to the EC2 section,

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but we will use it when we get to it.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In the meantime, you've seen how to create a role

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
for Amazon EC2 and how to attach correct permissions to it.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So that's it for this lecture.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
