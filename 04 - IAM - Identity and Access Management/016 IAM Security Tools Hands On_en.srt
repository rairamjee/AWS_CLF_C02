1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's generate a credentials report.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For this, on the left hand side,

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I just click on Credential report

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and then Download credential report

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is going to create a CSV file.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now this CSV, because I'm using a training account,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is not fascinating,

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but as we can see we have two rows in it.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have my root account and my account name, stephane.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We can see when the user was created,

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if the password was enabled,

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
when the password was last used and last changed,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
when is the next rotation to be expected

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
if we do enable password rotation?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Is MFA active?

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we can see it's active from my root accounts

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but it is not active for my Stefane accounts.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then access keys, are they generated or not?

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes, they're created for my Stefane account,

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but not for my root account,

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and when they were last rotated, last used and so on,

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you can get more information about other access keys

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and certificates and so on.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So this report is extremely helpful

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
if you want to look at some users

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that haven't been changing the password,

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
or using it, or their account,

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
it could be giving you a great way to find which users

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that deserve your attention from a security standpoint.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now let's have a look at IAM Access Advisor.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
For this, I'm gonna go to my user, stephane,

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and then on the right hand side, I click on Access Advisor.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And Access Advisor is going to show me

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
which services were accessed by my user and when.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So as you can see, organizations, health,

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
identity and access managers with IAM Service,

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
EC2, Resource Explorer, were all accessed by my user.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So I use my user to access these things

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
by clicking in the UI, but some services were not accessed,

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
for example, Alexa for Business

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
or AWS App2Container and so on.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So using Access and Advisor, you can actually have a look

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
at whether or not the user has the correct permissions.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And it turns out that maybe based on this access,

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
have 37 pages of this,

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
maybe the user needs access only to a few services

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
but not all of them.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And this UI allows you to drill down.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
On top of it, if a user accesses a specific service

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
for example Amazon EC2, we are told

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
that this is the administrator access

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
that granted access to this service.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So to summarize, Access Advisor becomes very helpful

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
when you need to do granular user access permissions on AWS.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So that's it for this lecture.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
