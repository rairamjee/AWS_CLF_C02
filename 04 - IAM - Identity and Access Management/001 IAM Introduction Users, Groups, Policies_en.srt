00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
- [Stephane] Welcome
to the first deep dive

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
on an iterator service.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first one is called IAM.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So IAM stands for identity
and access management.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It is a global service because in IAM,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we are going to create our
users and assign them to group.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So we've already used IAM without knowing,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
when we created an account,
we created a root accounts,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and has been created by default.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is the root user of our accounts.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And the only things you
should use it for is

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to set up your account
as we'll do it right now.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But then you shouldn't
use that account anymore,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
or even share it.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What you should be doing
instead, is create users.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So you will create users in IAM,

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and one user represents one
person within your organization.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And the users can be grouped
together if it makes sense.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's take an example
we have an organization

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
with six people.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You have Alice, Bob,
Charles, David, Edward

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and Fred so all these people
are in your organization.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now Alice, Bob, and
Charles they work together.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They're all developers.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So we're going to create a group called

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the group developers who regrouping Alice,

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Bob and Charles.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And it turns out that David
and Edward also work together.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we're going to create
an operations group.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now we have two groups within IAM.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now groups can only contain
users, not other groups.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So this is something very
important to understand.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Groups only contain users.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Now, some users don't
have to belong to a group.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
For example, Fred right here is alone,

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
he does not correspond to any group.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That is not best practice.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But it is something you can do in AWS.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And also, a user can
belong to multiple groups.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That means that for example,
if you know that Charles

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and David worked together,

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and they're part of your audit team,

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
you can create a third group
with Charles and David.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And as you can see, now, in this example,

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Charles and David are part
of two different groups.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So this is the possible
configurations for IAM.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So why do we create users
and why do we create groups?

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, because we want to allow
them to use our AWS accounts

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and to allow them to do so,

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
we have to give them permissions.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So users or groups can be assigned

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
what's called a JSON document.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll show you right now what
it means called a policy,

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
an IAM policy.

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So it looks just like this.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So you don't have to be a programmer.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is not programming.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is just describing
in, I think plain English,

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
what a user is allowed
to do or what a group

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and all the users within
that group are allowed to do.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So in this example, we can
see that we allow people

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to use the EC2 to service
and do describe on it,

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
to use the elastic load balancing service

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and to describe on it
and to use CloudWatch.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now we'll see what EC2
elastic load balancing

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and CloudWatch mean, but
through this JSON document

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that looks just like this.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We are allowing our users
to use some services in AWS.

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So these policies will
help us define permissions

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
of our users.

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And so in AWS, you don't allow
everyone to do everything

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
that would be catastrophic,

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
because a new user could
basically launch so many services

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and they will cost you a lot of money

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
or would be valid for security.

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So in AWS, you apply a principle called

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the least privilege principle.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So you don't give more
permissions than a user needs.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, so if a user just needs
access to three services,

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
just create a permission for that user.

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So now we have seen an overview IAM.

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's go in the next lecture

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
to practice creating users and groups.
