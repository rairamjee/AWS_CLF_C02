1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here are some general guidelines

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
on IAM and best practices, 'cause I don't want you

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
if you go to use AWS to make some mistakes.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So do not use a root account

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
except when you set up your AWS account.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So by now you should have two accounts, a root account

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and your own personal accounts.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And remember, one AWS user is equal to one physical user.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So if a friend of yours wants to use AWS,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
do not give them your credentials,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
instead, create another user for them.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You can assign user to groups

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and assign permission to groups to make sure

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that security is managed at the group level

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and should create a strong password policy.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Also, if you can use and enforce the use

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
of multi-factor authentication or MFA to really guarantee

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that your account is going to be safe or safer from hackers.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then you should create and use roles whenever

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you're giving permissions to AWS services,

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and that includes easy two instances

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
which are virtual servers.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you were to use AWS programmatically or using the CLI,

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so the CLI or some SDK, you must generate access keys,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and these access keys are just like passwords,

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
they're very secret.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So just keep them for yourself.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
To edit the permissions of your account,

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you can use the IAM credentials reports

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
or the IAM Access advisor feature.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Finally, never, ever, ever share your IAM users

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and access keys, I am very serious about it.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So that's it,

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
we are nearing the end of this section.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You know everything about IAM.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will see you in the next lecture.
