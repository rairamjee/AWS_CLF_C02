1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So let's go ahead

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and practice using the IAM service to create users in AWS.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So in the search bar,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I just type IAM and I go into the IAM console.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So upon arriving on the IAM Dashboard,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we have some security recommendations

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that we can for now not care about.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And what I want to draw your attention to

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
is that on the left hand side, we go to users.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So this is where we're creating to create users for IAM,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but first, let's notice something.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you go to the top right corner and click on Global,

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you can see that the region selection is not active.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That means that IAM as an entire service is a global service

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and therefore there is no region to be selected.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When you create a user in IAM,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
it will be available everywhere,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but some other consoles we'll see in this course

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
will be region-specific.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So just something to notice.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, so now we have users, and why do we create users?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, we create users,

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
because right now, we are using what's called the root user.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So if you click on this,

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you see there's just the account ID available to you.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So when you have it,

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that means you're using the root account

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and it's not best practice to use the root account.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So therefore, we want to create users such as admin users

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that will allow us to use our accounts more safely.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So for this, let's go ahead and create a user,

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and I will provide a username, for example, Stephane.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So of course I want to provide myself access

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to the management console,

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
so I'm going to do this,

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and we have the option to use identity center,

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
which is recommended,

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
or to create an IAM user.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I will choose the second option because it is more simple,

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and from an exam perspective,

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
this is the one you need to know about.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But don't worry,

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
this does not affect how your course is going to go.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, so we create an IAM user,

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and now we have to set the password.

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So if this was a user that was not me,

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I would leave it as auto-generated password,

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and I would leave this

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
so that the user must change this password

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
at the next sign-in,

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but because it is me,

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm just going to enter a custom password

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and I'm going to untick this

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
because I don't need to change my password

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
at the next login.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So let's click on next.

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Next, we have to add permissions to this user,

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
so we can add it directly or we can get started with groups.

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So let's create a group, and we're going to create a group.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The group name is going to be admin

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and the policy name is going to be administrator access.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So now that this is done,

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
we can add the user into the admin group.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So let's click on next,

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and we can review everything right now.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So we have the username, the permissions on the group,

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and we have tags, and tags are everywhere in AWS.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They're optional, but they allow you to give metadata

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
to many of your resources.

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
For example, I could say

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that the department of Stephane is engineering.

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is not something I'm going to do everywhere

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
on the course,

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but I want show you once how

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you can add tags to resources in AWS.

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, so now the user is created successfully.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So now we can email signing instructions or download

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
CSV files and then we can log in with this user.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But first, let's return to the user list

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and have a look at everything.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So here is my user lists, here is me

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and we also have groups.

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So if I go to the left hand side, user groups,

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
we have admins.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So let's observe admins.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So admins has one user in it named Stephane.

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And if you look at permissions of admins

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
you see that there is administrator access attached

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
to the admin group.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Now if I go to my user, Stephane in here,

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
we can look at permission policies

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and see it also has administrative access

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but this one has not been attached directly.

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It has been attached via the group admin.

95
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So that means that Stephane inherited any permissions

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
of the group admin it is in.

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And this is why we put users in groups.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It is a bit more simple to manage permissions this way.

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So now let's go back to our dashboard

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and we want to sign in with our user, Stephane.

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So first what we can do is look at our AWS accounts

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and it has an account ID and a Sign-in URL.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now you can customize this Sign-in URL very easily

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
by creating what's called an account alias.

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So it could be aws-stephane-v3 and then Create alias

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
so whatever alias until someone hasn't created it,

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
so it has to be unique.

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
For example, v5 is available.

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So now using this alias can simplify my signing URL.

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Now to sign in using my Stephane accounts

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
we could use the same browser

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
or we could create a new browser window in private mode.

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And the benefit of doing this is

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
that we can have two windows side by side using AWS.

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So if you don't do this, that's fine, but if you log

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
in using the Stephane account on the right hand side window

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
then you will be disconnected on the left hand side,

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
this is the only difference.

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So to use two accounts at the same time,

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the route on the left and my account on the right

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
what I'm doing as a trick is that I'm using a private window

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
on my web browser, and Chrome has this feature,

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Firefox as this feature, Safari as this feature, and so on.

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So by pasting the signing URL, as you can see,

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I get the sign in and as an IAM user

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and to get to this page, we can go back to one.

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And as you can see, when you do a sign in on AWS,

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
you have the root user sign in or the IAM user sign in.

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So to get back to this, we go to IAM user.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We enter either the account ID or the account alias

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that I can copy in here, and then we are taken to this page.

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So the IAM user name is going to be Stephane

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and the password is going to be whatever you have set

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
from before, then you sign in.

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So now the cool thing is that if I look

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
at the top right hand side, IAM logged in using my IAM user.

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So it says the account ID and the IAM user.

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But if I look on the top right hand side of here

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
it just says the account id

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
which shows me it's the root accounts.

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So here we are, we have the root accounts logged

142
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
in on the left hand side through a normal window

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and we have the IAM user logged in on the right hand side

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
through a private window.

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Please make sure not to lose your root account

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
logins and your admin login.

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Otherwise, you will be in deep trouble with your

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
account and you'll have to contact AWS for support.

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And currently I cannot help you with this.

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Now from a course perspective,

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I recommend you use your IAM user and not your root user

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
but this is just a normal recommendation.

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sometimes you'll see me using root

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
sometimes I'm using IAM user.

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But when you have to use roots or when you have

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
to use an IAM user, I will let you know in the course.

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't worry about that.

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Now for the rest of this section,

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
please keep these two windows open and I will

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
see you in the next lecture.
