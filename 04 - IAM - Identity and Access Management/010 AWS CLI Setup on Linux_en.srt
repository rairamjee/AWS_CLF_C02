1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay, so let's proceed

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
with installing the AWS CLI on Linux.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So for this I just google it, and I will choose installing

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the AWS CLI Version 2 on Linux because

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
this is the latest one,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and I'm going to scroll down.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And to install the CLI it goes installing.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We just have to run these three commands.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So the first one is to get a Zip file.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So I copy this, go into a terminal,

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and then I will paste it.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And here we go.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So this has been pasted, and it is downloading currently

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the installer.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The next thing we have to do is to unzip it.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So I copy this command and paste it,

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and this will unzip my installer.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Great.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And the last thing is to run the installer as root,

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so I'll do sudo and then install.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This should prompt me for my password,

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which I enter right now,

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and then the installation proceed.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now it says you can run,

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
"user/local/bin/AWS minus minus version,"

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
or very simply, "AWS minus minus version"

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
if your user local bin is in your path,

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and there we go.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The AWS CLI has been installed as you can see.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It says AWS CLI/2.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and then you are getting a different version based on

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
when you do this.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And then you get Python and Linux and Botocore,

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so you are good to go.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When this works we can run any command on the AWS CLI

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and you can go ahead, with the rest of the lectures.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you got ant issues please read this

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and it will tell you what's going on and that it,

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will see you in the next lecture.
