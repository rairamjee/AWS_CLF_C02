1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Throughout the CCP exam, you are going

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
to get a lot of questions on something called

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Shared Responsibility Model.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And this is to ensure that you know

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
what AWS is responsible for,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and what you are responsible for.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now, I want to include some bits of information

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
within some sections to give you an idea of how

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the shared responsibility model works for AWs.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So AWS is responsible for everything

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that they do, for example, their infrastructure

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and their global network security,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the configuration and vulnerabilty analysis

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
of the services they offer,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and any sign of compliance

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that they are responsible for.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But regarding IAM, you are responsible for a lot

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of things that AWS will not do for you.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You are responsible for creating your own users,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
your groups, your roles, your policies,

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the management of these policies,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and the monitoring of that.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You are responsible for enabling MFA

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
on all accounts and enforcing this, not AWS.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are also responsible to make sure

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that the keys are rotated often.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You need to make sure that you use the IAM tools

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to apply the appropriate permissions,

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and again, you are responsible

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
for analyzing the access patterns

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and review the permissions in your accounts,

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
not AWS.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So this is a very simple example,

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but an obvious one. But AWS is responsible

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
for all the infrastructure,

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and you are responsible for how you use

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that infrastructure.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is just one of these lectures

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
on shared responsibility.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I hope you liked it,

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
