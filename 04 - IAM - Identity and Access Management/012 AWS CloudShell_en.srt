1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So I would like to talk to you about an alternative

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to using the terminal to issue commands against AWS.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And this is using cloud shell.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So cloud shell is this icon right here on the top

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
right corner of your screen.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And if you don't see it, just make sure you check

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
out the clutch shell availability regions

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
because it's not available everywhere.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And so if you go to the clash of FAC, you can see

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that there are some regions that's not available.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So let's have a look right now with the regions.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Here we go. Question three.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right now that's, I'm recording.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's only available in one of these regions.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So by the way, I would recommend if you want to follow

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
along to just use one of these regions, then

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so we can use cloud shell, but if you don't use cloud shell

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
in this hands-on, that is completely fine.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If the terminal was working for you, do not worry.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're good to go.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay. So we have cloud shell in here and within cloud shell

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
you could take a minute maybe to launch your environment.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You can issue commands.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For example, you can issue the AWS commands.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So as you can see is installed, if I do

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
either of us management is version, as we can see

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm on version two.one right now using cloud shell.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So cloud shell is basically a terminal in the cloud of AWS.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's free to use.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay. So the cool thing about cloud shell is

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that whenever you are using the CLI, so for example

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
it was am list users.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is going to return for you an API call

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
as if the credentials being used, where the credentials

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of the accounts of you using the cloud right now

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
which is why the API calls are working.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And by default, you can specify any kind

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
of region you want to do.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The API call using the management is region arguments, but

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
in cloud shell, the default region is going to

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
be the region you're currently in

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
logged in right now in cloud shell.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So this is another thing that's good to know.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay. Other things that you should know

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
about cloud shell is that you have a full repository.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So for example, right now, as we can see

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
we have zero files within cloud shell.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But if you just do

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
echo

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
tests

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
into demo dot TXT, this is going to create a text

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
file that contains the word texts tests.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And so it turns out that

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
if you happen to restart your cloud shell

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
then this file will stick.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So all the files you are creating

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
within your cultural environment, for example

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
this demo that's TXT are going to stay.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And the other cool thing you can do

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
about cloud shell is that you can configure it.

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So you can say what font size you want, smallest

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
medium and large.

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And so on the tech, the theme you want, so light or dark

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
if he wants safe based or nuts.

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So resist like a bigger cloud shell for me right now.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And also you have the possibility to download

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and upload files.

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So for example, if I want you to get the full path

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
to my file, so did this demo let's six.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can just copy it right now.

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Action and download foul, and then do demo dot TXT.

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And this will go ahead and download the file for me.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And alternatively, you could upload your own files

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
into your cultural environments.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So I want to show you these handy options

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
because for me, they are lifesavers.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And finally, if you wanted more tabs into this environment

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
you could have a new tab.

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can split into column example, and there you go.

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You have two terminals

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
into cloud shell connected at the same time.

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So really that once show you the power

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
of cloud shell in this hands-on again, you're doing it.

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You know, all the commands that data just wants to show you.

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you're a power user, then you can do these commands

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and how they would work with cloud shell.

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So the bottom line for this lecture again, is number one

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
cloud shell is only available in some regions.

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So maybe try to choose one

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
of the regions where cloud shell is available.

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If you want to use it, if you don't want to use cloud shell

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
or cloud shell is not working for you.

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is completely fine.

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
As long as you use the terminal, the way we configured it

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
from before, this will work just fine.

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And you'll be fine in the course to either use cloud shell

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
or your terminal to perform the commands

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
with the CLA against AWS.

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay. And also remember that I really like the upload

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and download feature of cloud shell

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
choose to upload files and download files from it.

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay. So that's it for this lecture.

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I hope you liked it.

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
