1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay so we are going to install

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
the aws command line on Windows.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So for this we do aws CLI install windows on Google.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And this will give us the list link

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we want to install the aws-cli version 2 on Windows.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay this is the latest and so we'll up to dates.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It doesn't change much versus version 1,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
it is just some improved performance and capability,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but the API's exactly the same

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and there's also an improved installer.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So I'm going to scroll down,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in here and to Install on Windows

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
where you can just simply

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
install it using the MSI installer,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so I just click on this link to download the MSI installer.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then I'm going to run the installer

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
so it should very very simple.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now the installer is starting,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I click on Next.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I accept the terms of the license,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
click on Next,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Install and then we wait for the installer to be done.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, I want to allow whatever this is doing.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay so the installer is now complete.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I click on Finish

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and now I can go ahead and open a command line,

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so I'll do command line,

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Command Prompt here we go on Windows,

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and to be sure that it's fully installed

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I just type aws--version

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and press enter,

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and if you get a result like this:

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
aws-cli, a version that starts with a 2,

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
then Python, Windows,

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that means that your aws-cli

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
is now properly installed on Windows

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and you're good to go.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Finally just note that if you want to upgrade your aws-cli

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
then you just need to re-download that MSI installer

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and just re-run the install

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and it will be automatically upgraded.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But as soon as you have this output you're good to go

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and you can follow me in the next lecture.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So see you in the next lecture.
