1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So we have seen how to access AWS

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
using the Management console,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which is the Web interface that we've done

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so far in this course, but there are, actually,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
three different options to access AWS.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So the first one is a Management console,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
as we've seen, and is protected by your username,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
password, maybe multifactor authentication.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then there is the CLI, Command Line Interface,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and this is something we will set up on our computer,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and this is protected by access keys,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and access keys our credentials we're going to download

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in a few seconds that will allow us

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to access AWS from our terminal.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then, finally, there is the SDK,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the AWS Software Development Kit,

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which is used whenever you want to call APIs from AWS

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
from within your application code.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And again, these will be protected

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
by the exact same access keys.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So how do we generate access keys?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well we will do this through the Management console,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and users are responsible for their own access keys,

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and access keys, from the user perspective,

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
there are secret, just like a password,

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so if you generate your own access keys

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
do not share them with your colleagues,

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
because they can generate their own access keys as well.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So really make sure that you treat your access key ID

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
just like your username,

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and your secret access key just like your password,

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
you do not share them with other people.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So when you go into the Management console,

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
you get access key as there's a button

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to create access keys, and then it gives you the right

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
to download it in the very second.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And so, for example, here's a fake access key ID

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and a fake secret access key,

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and these, when loaded into my Command Line Interface,

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
would allow me to access the AWS API,

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and we'll do this in the hands-on in a second.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So again, remember, I want to make sure

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
that you don't have any security issues

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
while doing this course or at work,

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
do not share your access keys, they are private to you.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So if you're new to the Cloud, and programming and so on,

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
or IT, then you might not know what's a CLI.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So CLI stands for Command Line Interface,

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and the AWS CLI is a tool that allows you to interact

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
with the AWS services using commands

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
from your command-line shell.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So whenever you see some code where you type a command line,

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and then it returns a result, for example,

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
aws, s3, cp, and so on, this is what we call the CLI.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And we are using the AWS CLI

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
because we start every command by the word AWS.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now with this CLI, you get direct access

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to the public APIs of your AWS services

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
which is going to be very helpful in this course.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And, then, using the CLI you can develop scripts

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to manage your resources and automate some of your tasks.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The CLI is open-source,

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you can find all the source code on GitHub,

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and it is an alternative to using

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the AWS Management console.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I know that some people, actually,

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
do not even use the Management console,

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
they only use the CLI, for example.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So what's the SDK now?

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
SDK stands for Software Development Kit,

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and this is a set of library,

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
this is going to be language specific,

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
so you're going to have an SDK

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
for different programming languages,

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and similarly, it will allow you to access and manage

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
your AWS services and APIs programmatically,

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but this time the SDK is not something that you use

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
within your terminal, it is something that you embed

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
within your application that you have to code.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So your application will have the AWS SDK

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
from within them.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It supports many different programming languages,

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
such as JavaScript, Python, PHP.NET,

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++,

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
all of that's our programming languages.

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There's also the mobile SDK,

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
if you're using Android or iOS,

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and the IoT, so Internet of Things device SDK

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
in case you're using some thermal sensors

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
or bike locks that are connected, all these kinds of things.

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So to give you an example of what you can build

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
with the SDK, well the AWS CLI that we're going to be using

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
in this course is actually built

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
on the AWS SDK for Python named Boto.

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So that's it for this lecture.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now in then the next lecture, we're going to practice

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
setting up the CLI and dealing with access keys,

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so I will see you in the next lecture.
