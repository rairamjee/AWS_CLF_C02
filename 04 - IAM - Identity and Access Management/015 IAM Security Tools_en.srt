00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We are nearing the end of the section,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
but first let's talk about the kind of security tools

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we have in IAM.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So we can create an IAM Credentials Report

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and this is at your account-level.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This report will contain all your accounts users

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and the status of their various credentials.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We'll be actually generating it right now

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and having a look at it.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The second security tool we're gonna use in IAM

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is called IAM Access Advisor.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This one is at the user-level

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and the Access Advisor is going to show

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the service permissions granted to a user

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and when those services were last accessed.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This will be very helpful because we are talking already

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
about the principle of least privilege,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and so using this tool, we're able to see which permissions

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
are not used and reduce the permission a user can get

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to be inline with the principle of least privilege.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So I will see you in the next lecture

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to show you how to use the security tools.
