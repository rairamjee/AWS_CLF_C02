1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me show you how to create access keys.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So I'm gonna click on my username, Stephane,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and I'm gonna go under Security credentials.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I will scroll down and I will create an access key.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
As you can see,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
there are some selection you need to do,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and based on the selection I'm doing,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
for example, I want access key for the CLI,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
AWS is going to have an alternative recommended.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, for the CLI,

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it's better to use CloudShell

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which I will show you in the next lecture,

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
so don't worry about it.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Or to use the CLI V2 and an authentication

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
through the IAM Identity Center,

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which I will not show you

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
because it's a bit more complicated.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So based on what you wanna do,

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
if it's local code application running outside of AWS

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
or in AWS and so on,

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
you will have some recommendation in the bottom.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For now, we're going to use the CLI

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and we'll use these access keys

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and we'll click here to say

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
"I understand the above recommendation,"

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and I still want to create an access key

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
because it is important for you to understand

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
how they are, how they work, what they are, and so on.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So let's create this access key.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And now, this is the only time

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
you'll be able to have access to the access key

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and the secret access key.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So I will go back now

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
to a previous version of that lecture

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
where you see the old UI,

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
but don't worry nothing changes from that point on.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The first thing I have to do is to configure my AWS CLI.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm going to type: aws configure.

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And then I am greeted with entering my access key id.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Very nice, I can just enter this one, and press Enter.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And then I'm greeted with entering my secret access key,

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
which I will enter right here as well.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The default region name,

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so this is a region that is close to you.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I will choose eu-west-1

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because I will be doing all my tutorials eu-west-1,

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
but you will choose your own region

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and you can enter your own region name.

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The region name, by the way, you can get directly

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
from this drop down right here.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It shows you the name of the region

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
as well as the region code.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So for me, I'm going to use my eu-west-1.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll press Enter, and in the default output format,

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll just press Enter as well.

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So now my AWS CLI is configured,

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and so we can have a look at how it works.

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We can do: aws iam list-users,

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and press Enter.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And this will list all the users in my account.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And as we can see,

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the user I have right now is called Stephane,

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
here is the UserId, here is the ARN,

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
when it was created,

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and when the password was last used.

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Which is very similar to what I would get

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
if I were to go into this UI right here.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So the Management Console and the CLI

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
do provide similar kind of information.

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Next, I want to show you what happens

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
if we remove permissions from our users.

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So I'm gonna go to admins

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and I'm going to remove the Stephane user

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
from the group admin.

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And so again, if I go back to my user, Stephane,

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
it doesn't have any permissions.

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And I did this, obviously, with my root account,

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
not the other accounts.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So now if I go into my UI

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and obviously refresh this page,

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm going to get an error saying that, yes,

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I do not have the permissions to do this.

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But let's try to do the same thing with the CLI.

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So we're going to do an "iam list-user" call,

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and we get no response because actually it was being denied.

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, the CLI permissions

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
are obviously going to be the exact same

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
as the permissions you get from the IAM console.

89
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, the takeaway from this lecture

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
is that you can access AWS using the Management Console

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
or using access key and secret access key

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that you can configure, and then use into the CLI.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So hope you liked it,

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And obviously, do not forget

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to add your user back into the group,

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
otherwise that would be horrible.

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I'm gonna go into Groups, admins,

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and I'm going to add my Stephane user back into my group,

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and now I am an administrator again.

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So that's it, I will see you in the next lecture.
