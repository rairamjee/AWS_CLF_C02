1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so now let's discuss, IAM policies in depth.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So let's imagine we have a group of developers,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Alice, Bob and Charles, and we,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
attach a policy at the group level.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In that case, the policy will get applied

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to every single member of the group

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so both Alice, Bob, and Charles

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
they will all get access and inherit this policy.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, if you have a second group with operations

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with a different policy,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
David and Edward will have a different policy

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
than the group of developers.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If Fred is a user,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
it has the possibility not to belong to a group.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And we have the possibility to create what's called

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
an inline policy which has a policy

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that's only attached to a user.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So that user could or could not belong to a group

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
you can have inline policies for whatever user you want.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And finally, if Charles and David both belong

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to the audit team and you attach a policy to the audit team

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
as well, Charles and David will also inherit

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that policy from the audit team.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So in this case, Charles has a policy from developers

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and a policy from audit team.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And David has a policy from audit team

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and a policy from the operations team.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That should make a lot of sense

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
when we get into the hands-on.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now, in terms of the policy structure,

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
you just need to know at a high level how it works,

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
as well as how it is named.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So this is something you will see quite a lot in AWS,

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
so get familiar with this structure

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
this is adjacent documents.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And so an IAM policy structure, consists of a

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
version number, so usually it's 2012-10-17,

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
this is the policy language version.

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And ID which is how to identify that policy,

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
this is optional.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And then more statements,

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and statements can be one or multiple ones,

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and a statement has some very important parts.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So the Sid is a statement ID, which is an identifier

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
for the statement, which is optional as well,

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
so on the right hand side is the number one.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The effect of the policy itself, so it is whether or not

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the statement allows or denies access to certain API,

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
so in the right hand side, this says allow,

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but you can see deny as well.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The principle consists of which accounts, user or role

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
which, to which this policy will be applied to.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So in this example, it's applied to the root accounts

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
of your AWS accounts.

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Action is the list of API calls that will be

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
either denied or allowed based on the effect.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And the resource is a list of resources,

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
to which the actions will be applied to.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So in this example, it is a bucket,

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but it could be many different things.

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And finally in, not represented here

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
but there's a condition to which when

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
this statement should be applied or not,

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and this is not representative here because it is optional.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So going into the exam, you need to make sure

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that you really understand the effect, the principle,

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the action and resource, but don't worry,

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you will see those along the way in the course

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
so you should be confident with them

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
by the end of the course.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
