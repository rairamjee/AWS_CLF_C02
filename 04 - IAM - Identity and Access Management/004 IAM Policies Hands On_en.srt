1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So now let's have a look

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
at IAM policies in depth.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So first of all, let's go into users.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And as you can see, the user Stephane

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is part of the admin group,

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and therefore, has administrator access permissions to AWS.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That means that if I use my user Stephane

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to go into the IAM console, so now I'm using my user,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and then I go to the left-hand side and click on users,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
as you can see, I can see my user Stephane,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which is right here.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So my user Stephane has permission to do anything

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because it's an administrator.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But what I'm going to do is that I'm going to the groups

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of admins and then I'm going to remove my user Stephane

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
from that group.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So by removing the user, which I've done right now,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
then Stephane loses its permissions on the right-hand side.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How do we make sure of this?

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, let's refresh this page.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And as you can see, now I see zero users

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and I get an access denied and it said

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that I don't have the permission to do iamListUsers.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And so therefore, because I removed my Stephane user

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
from the admin group, then I've lost permissions to look

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
at users on the right-hand side.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So let's try to fix this.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So let's go into IAM

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and we're gonna go under users, find Stephane in here.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And right now, as you can see,

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Stephane has zero permission policies

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but let's add permissions.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So we can add permissions directly

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
or create an inline policy.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So let's add permissions, and this is going to be easier.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And so again, we could add the user back to a group.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's not what we want.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Or we could attach policies directly to my user.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And so the policy I'm going to attach is going

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
to be IAMReadOnlyAccess.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So this will allow my user Stephane

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
to read anything on IAM, which is what we want.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So let's add this permission

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and now this policy has been added.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So back in here, let's refresh this page.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And as you can see now, I can finally do my API call again

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and look at the Stephane user in my users category.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So I can view users, I can view user groups, such as admin

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but can I create a group?

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's try to create the developer group

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and then create this group.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And as you can see, I cannot create it

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
because I'm not allowed to actually create a group.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm only given the read-only access on IAM.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And so therefore, because I have read-only access,

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I cannot create groups.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So this shows you that you can only permission users

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
for what they're supposed to do.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And of course, if I wanted to give access to create groups

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
on the right-hand side,

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will need to attach a bigger permission sets,

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
such as the IAM full access.

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So next, let's do something.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So next, I'm going to go into the left-hand side

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
under user groups, and I'm going to create a group.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So this group is going to be called developers.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And then I'm going to add the user Stephane in this group

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and I'm going to attach whatever policy I can find,

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
for example, AlexaForBusiness

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but it doesn't really matter.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Just attach the first policy you can

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and let's create this group.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, so this has been added.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And finally, let's go into the admin group.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And again, we're going to add users

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and re-add Stephane into this group.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So now if we go back to the Stephane user, so let's go

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
into IAM and look at the users and look at Stephane,

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm going to shut down this message on right-hand side.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So if we look at Stephane as the user, as we can see,

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
we have three permission policies attached to my user.

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We have the administrator access that has been inherited

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
from the group admin.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We have this AlexaForBusiness managed policy

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that has been attached via the group developers.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And finally, IAMReadOnlyAccess

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
that has been attached directly.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And so as you can see,

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I inherited different permissions based

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
on how it's been attached.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So now let's look at policies in detail.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So on the left-hand side, let's look at policies.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And first, let's have a look

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
at this AdministratorAccess policy.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So if we look at it, it's the permission

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that gave us administrator access to everything.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And if you look at the permissions defined

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
in this policy as a summary, as you can see,

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
this allows all the services in AWS.

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And this number can change over time.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It doesn't matter.

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The course will be up to date.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So all these services, for example, App Mesh

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
or Alexa for Business or Amplify, they all have full access.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So how is this permission defined?

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, if you click on JSON,

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
this is the JSON form of this policy, and we can see

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that here we have allow Action, star and resource, star.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So star in AWS means anything.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So it means we allow any action on any resource.

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And of course, allowing any action

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
on any resource is exactly the same thing

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
as giving administrator access to someone.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So this is how it's been defined.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If we have a look at another policy, for example,

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the IAMReadOnlyAccess that we saw from before.

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So if we look at it, we see

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that IAM is authorized with Full: List and Limited: Read.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And if I click on it, you can actually have a look

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
at all the API calls that has been allowed

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
as part of this policy, which is very handy.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But if we look at how this has been actually defined,

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
let's click on JSON.

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And here we have the JSON document that shows

125
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
how this has been defined.

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So the effect is allow, and then we list out the API calls

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
that are being allowed.

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So we have this one, this one, and then we have Get*.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So when you have Get*, it says that anything that starts

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
with Get and then has something after is authorized.

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
For example, get users or get groups.

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Same for list.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So we have a List*.

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So list users or list groups.

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So by using a star,

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
we encompass and group many API calls together.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So all this is allowed on Resource*.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And so therefore, that summarizes

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
what the read-only IAM access policy is made of.

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So this is very handy.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You can also create your own policy.

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So let's create a policy

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and we have a visual editor or a JSON editor.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So if you have JSON, you can just very simply edit this

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and create your JSON document with this builder,

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
which is very handy.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Or you can use the visual editor.

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And for example, let's say IAM,

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
we wanna create stuff for IAM.

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And what action do we wanna authorize?

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, we want to authorize ListUsers.

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So we're going to take this and GetUser.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So just two API calls.

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And as we can see, we have selected one out of 38 in list

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and one out of 32 in read.

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And then what do we want to authorize this on?

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So on all resources or only specific resources?

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So this is a very simple one

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but as you can see, this builder is very handy.

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And when you click on next,

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
you can have a look and say MyIAMPermissions.

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And then we create this policy.

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And if we have a look at the policy we created,

164
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
we can have a look at the corresponding JSON

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and see that indeed through the visual editor,

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
we allowed iam:ListUsers and iam:getUser on Resource*.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And then this policy, we can attach to groups

168
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
or to users and so on.

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So this is how you manage permissions in AWS.

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So now to just wrap up this hands-on,

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
let's go to user groups

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and we're going to delete the developers group

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
because we don't need it.

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then I'm going to go into my Stephane user

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and I'm going to just remove this IAMReadOnlyAccess

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
that had attached directly.

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So now Stephane only belongs to the group admin

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and it has administrator access.

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So of course, if I go back

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
to my IAM console in here and I just look at users,

181
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
as you can see, yes, everything is showing fine.

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So it is working correctly.

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay, so that's it for this lecture.

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
