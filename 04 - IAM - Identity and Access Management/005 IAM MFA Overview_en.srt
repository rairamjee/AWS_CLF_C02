1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now that we have created users in groups,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
it is time for us to protect these users

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in groups from being compromised.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So for this, we have two defense mechanisms.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first one is to define

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
what's called a password policy.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Why?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, because the stronger the password you use,

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the more security for your accounts.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So in AWS you can set up a password policy

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with different options.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The first one is you can set a minimum

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
password length and you can

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
require specific character types.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For example, you may want

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to have an uppercase letter, lowercase letter,

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
number, non alphanumeric characters,

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for example, a question mark and so on.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then you can allow or not IAM users

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to change their own passwords,

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or you can require users to change their password

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
after some time to make your password expired,

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
for example, to say every 90 days,

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
users have to change their passwords.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Finally, you can also prevent password reuse

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
so that users, when they change their passwords,

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
don't change it to the one

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that they already have or change it

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
to the one they had before.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So this is great.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A password policy really is helpful

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
against brute force attacks on your account.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But there's a second defense mechanism

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that you need to know going into the exam.

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And this is the Multi-Factor Authentication or MFA.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It is possible, you already used it

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
on some websites, but on AWS it's a must

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and it's very recommended to use it.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So users have access to your account

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and they can possibly do a lot of things,

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
especially if they're administrators.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They can change configuration,

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
delete resources and other things.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So you absolutely want to protect

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
at least your root account and hopefully,

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
all your IAM users.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So how do we protect them on top of the password?

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, you use an MFA device.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So what is MFA?

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
MFA is using the combination of a password

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that you know and a security device that you own.

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And these two things together

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
have a much greater security

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
than just a password.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So for example, let's take Alice.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Alice knows her password,

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but she also has an MFA generating token.

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And by using these things together

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
while logging in, she's going to be able

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to do a successful login on MFA.

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So the benefit of MFA is that even if Alice

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
has lost her password

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
because it's stolen or it's hacked,

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
the account will not be compromised

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because the hacker will need to also get a hold

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
of the physical device of Alice,

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
that could be her phone, for example,

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
to do a login.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Obviously that is much less likely.

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So what are the MFA devices option in AWS?

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And you need to know them going into the exam,

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but don't worry, they're quite simple.

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The first one is a virtual MFA device.

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is what we'll be using in the hands-on.

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And so you can use Google Authenticator,

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
which is just working on one phone at a time,

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
or using Authy.

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So for Authy, you have support

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
for multiple tokens on a single device.

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So that means that with the virtual MFA device,

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
you can have your root account,

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
your IAM user, another account, another IAM user.

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's up to you.

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You can have as many users and accounts

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
as you want on your virtual MFA device,

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
which make it a very easy solution to use.

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now we have another thing

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
called a Universal 2nd Factor

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
or U2F Security Key,

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and that is a physical device.

91
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
For example, a YubiKey by Yubico

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and Yubico is a third party to AWS.

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is not AWS that provides it.

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is a third party.

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And we use a physical device

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
because maybe it's super easy,

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you put it on your key fobs

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and you're good to go.

99
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So this YubiKey supports multiple root

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and IAM users using a single security key.

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So you don't need as many keys as users,

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
otherwise there will be a nightmare.

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Then you have other options.

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You have a hardware key fob MFA device,

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
for example, this one provided by Gemalto,

106
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
which is also a third party to AWS.

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And finally, if you are using the cloud

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
of the government in the US, the AWS GovCloud,

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
then you have a special key fob

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that looks like this

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that is provided by SurePassID,

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
which is also a third party.

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So that's it.

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We've seen the theory

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
on how to protect your account,

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
but let's go in the next lecture

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to implement that.

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So I will see you in the next lecture.
