1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So we have to talk about

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
the last component of IAM,

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
which is called IAM Roles.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So some AWS services that we'll be launching

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
throughout this course will need to perform actions

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
on our behalf, on our account, okay?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And for this to do these actions,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
they're just like users,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
they will need some kind of permissions.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So we need to assign permissions to AWS services

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and to do so,

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we're going to create what's called an IAM Role.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So these IAM role will be just like a user,

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but they are intended to be used not by physical people,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but instead they will be used by AWS services.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So what does that mean?

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's a bit confusing.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So for example,

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we are going to create throughout this course,

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
an EC2 Instance.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
An EC2 Instance is just like a virtual server,

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and we'll see this in the next section.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But so this EC2 Instance may want to

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
perform some actions on AWS and to do so,

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
we need to give permissions to our EC2 Instance.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To do so, we're going to create an IAM Role and together

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
they're going to make one entity.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And together, once the EC2 Instance is trying

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to access some information from AWS,

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
then it will use the IAM Role.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And if the permission assigned to the IAM Role is correct,

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
then we're going to get access to the call

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
we're trying to make.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So some common roles include

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
what I just showed you, EC2 Instance roles,

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but also other things that perform actions against AWS

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
we'll see in this course.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For example, Lambda Function Roles or CloudFormation.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I know this is a high level of review.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In the next lecture we'll be creating a role,

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but we won't be using it yet until the next section,

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but let's go ahead and create a role.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I will see you in the next lecture.
