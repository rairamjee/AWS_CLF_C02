1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's install the AWS CLI on mac

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and for this we're just going to go on Google

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and make sure to choose a link

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
installing the AWS CLI version 2 on macOS.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And then we're just going to follow the process,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so we'll scroll down

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and see what they say.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And here is how to install it.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So we can just download a pkg file

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and this will be a graphical installer.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So you download the pkg file.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then you click on continue, continue, continue

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and you agree.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then you say, "Okay, install for all the users

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
"on this computer."

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Click on continue

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and then click on install,

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and this goes ahead and installs the CLI on mac.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So we wait for everything to be done,

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the files are being written.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, the installation is now successful

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and we'll move the installer to trash.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And now to fill this out,

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you open a terminal on mac.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So you just go ahead and type, for example, "terminal",

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and this will give you a terminal app.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Mine is called iterm on mac,

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
which is a free terminal that you can use.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And then you just type aws -- version

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and if everything is going well,

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
then it should give you back the version

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
of the AWS executable.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So let's wait for a little bit.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And we get the answer,

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
AWS CLI 2.0.10,

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
so that means that everything has been installed correctly.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So that's it for this lecture.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In case of issues,

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
please have a look at this guide.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It will have the answer for you.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And that's it for me.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will see you in the next lecture.
