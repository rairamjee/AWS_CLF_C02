00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here is a summary for IAM.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We've seen IAM users and they should be mapped

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to an actual physical user within your company.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And this user will have a password for the AWS console.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now we can group these users into groups

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and therefore users only.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We can attach policies

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
or share JSON documents that outline the permission

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
for users or groups.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And we can also create roles

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and these roles will be identities, but this time

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
for maybe EC2 instances or other AWS services.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We assume that for security

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
we can enable multi-factor authentication so MFA

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and also set a password policy for our users.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We can use the CLI to manage your services

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
using the command line

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
or the SDK to manage your AWS services,

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
using a programming language.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Finally, we can create access keys to access AWS

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
using the CLI or the SDK.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And finally, we can audit our IAM usage

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
by creating an IAM credentials report

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and also using the IAM access advisor service.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So that's it for this lecture.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I hope you liked it.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
