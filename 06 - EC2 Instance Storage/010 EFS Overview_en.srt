1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, here's a third type of storage

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
you can attach onto an EC2 instance.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And this is a network file system or NFS.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, EFS stands for elastic file system

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and it is a managed network file system.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And the idea and the benefits of it

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
is that it can be mounted to hundreds

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
of EC2 instances at a time.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, before we had an EBS volume attached

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to only one EC2 instance at a time.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But with an EFS drive, you can mount it

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
onto hundreds of EC2 instances.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, that makes it a shared network file system

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or shared NFS.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, EFS works only with your Linux EC2 instances.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And on top of it, it works

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
across multiple availability zones.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, it is possible for an instance

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in one AZ to be attaching the same EFS volume

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
as the instance in another AZ.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now, EFS is highly available, scalable, pretty expensive.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's about three times the price of a gp2 EBS volume,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but you pay per use and you don't plan for capacity.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So, that means that if you store 20 gigabytes of data

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
onto your EFS drive then you're only going to pay

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
for these 20 gigabytes.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, if you look at the diagram, this is very easy.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We have an EFS file system with a security group,

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and then we have EC2 instances

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
in various availability zones connected to it.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, we have EC2 instances in us-east-1a,

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
EC2 instances in us-east-1b,

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
as well as EC2 instances in us-east-1c.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And they're all connected to the same EFS File system.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So now, let's outline the exact differences

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
between EBS and EFS.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, with EBS, say we had EC2 instance

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
in one AZ and another one.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Then the EBS volume can only be attached

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to one instance in one specific AZ.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And the EBS volumes are bound

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
to specific availability zones.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But if we wanted to move over the EBS volume

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
from one AZ to another, we could create a snapshot,

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
it would create an EBS snapshot

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and then restore that snapshot into a new availability zone.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And effectively we would've moved the EBS volume over.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But this is a copy, this is not an in-sync replica.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is a copy, and that would mean

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that this drive can now be used by another EC2 instance.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
EFS is a network file system.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That means that whatever is on the EFS drive

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
is shared by everything that is mounted to it.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, what does that mean?

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Say we have many instances in Availability Zone 1 on one

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
or many instances as well on Availability Zone 2.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
At the same time, all these instances

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
can mount the same EFS drive, okay,

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
using a mount target, and they will all see the same files.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, that makes it a shared file system.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, hopefully that makes it a very easy way

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
to understand the difference between EBS and EFS.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And this is something that the exam will test you on.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There is a storage class you need to know for EFS

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and it's called EFS infrequent access or EFS-IA.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So, storage class is going to be cost-optimized

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
for files that you don't access very often.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, for example, you don't access these files every day.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And this storage class will give you

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
upto 92% lower cost for storing the data

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
compared to the other surge class,

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
which is called EFS standard.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And if you enable EFS-IA, then EFS

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
will automatically move your files to EFS-IA,

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
based on the last times they were accessed

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and something called a lifecycle policy.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So, let's take an example.

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We have our EFS file system.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We have three files in EFS standard

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and maybe a fourth file in EFS standard.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This one hasn't been accessed for 60 days,

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that means that no one has read this file.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And no one has been writing to this file either, right?

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So, if you define your lifecycle policy

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and you enable EFS-IA, then for example, you can say,

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
hey, after 60 days, please move this file

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to a different storage class which is called EFS-IA,

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
which is going to have some cost saving.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And this is going to be done automatically.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now, next time you access this file,

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
it's going to be be put back into EFS standard

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
because it's more accessed more often, right?

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So, the idea is that this is a cost saving optimization.

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And from an application perspective,

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
there is really no drawbacks.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's very transparent to the applications,

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that means that your applications don't even need

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to know where the file is if it's an EFS standard,

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
or EFS-IA, it will access all these files the same way.

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's just behind the scenes,

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
EFS will do some cost optimizations.

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So, something to need to know, going to your exam.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
