1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
As usual, shared responsibility is important

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
going into the certified cloud practitioner exam.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And so we need to understand where is the responsibility

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
for AWS and yours regarding EC2 storage.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So AWS, of course, is responsible for their infrastructure,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but also because in the technical specification of EBS, EFS,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the tell you the data is replicated across many hardware,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
it is AWS responsibility to perform that replication.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So that if one day some hardware is not working,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you as a customer is not impacted.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Also, anytime an EBS drive would fail,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or one part of it would fail.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It is obviously AWS responsibility

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to replace that faulty hardware.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And finally, because we're talking about data storage,

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
it is their responsibility to ensuring that their employees

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
cannot access your data.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now what is your responsibility as a customer?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, setting up any backup or snapshot procedures

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and guidelines is very important to ensure

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that you don't lose your data.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Setting up data encryption is another layer of protection

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to ensure that people cannot have access to your data,

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
would it be AWS or other customers of AWS,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
even though obviously,

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
security would be in place for it not to happen,

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but it would be an interesting second layer of security.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Any data you set,

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
obviously, on the drive is your responsibility.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Anything you write to that disk is your own responsibility.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And if you're using an EC2 instance store,

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you need to understand the risks

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that are associated with it,

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
which is that you can lose the drive if somehow

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
there's a faulty hardware,

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
or that if you stop or terminate the EC2 instance

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
that has an instant store,

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
then the data will be lost.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So again, it would be responsibility

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to back it up in the first place.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay, that's it, I hope that was helpful

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
