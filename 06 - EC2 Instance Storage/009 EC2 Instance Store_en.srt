1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So we've seen a way to attach a network drive

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
onto our EC2 Instances

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but they have limited performance

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and I said with cause because it's a really good performance

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but sometimes you want something even higher performance

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and that is going to be a hardware disk

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
attached onto you EC2 Instance.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So the EC2 Instance is a virtual machine

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but it is obviously attached to a real hardware server.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And some of these servers do have disk space

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that is attached directly you know,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
with a physical connection onto the server.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And so a special type of EC2 Instance can leverage

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
something called an EC2 Instance Store,

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
which is the name of the hardware,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the hard drive attached to the physical server.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So what we do with EC2 Instance Store,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we use them for better I/O performance.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We also make sure that they have good through put

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and so on, so they're a great choice

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
when you want to have extremely high disk performance.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But the caveat is that if you stop

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
or you terminate your EC2 Instance,

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that has an Instance Store,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
then the storage will be lost.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And therefore it's called an ephemeral storage

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
so that means that the EC2 Instance Store

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
can now be used as a durable long term place

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to store your data.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So what is a good use case for it then?

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well if you have a buffer, a cache,

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
you want to have scratch data or temporary content,

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
this would be a great place to do these things

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but not for long term storage.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For long term storage, EBS for example

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
is a great use case.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Finally, in case the on the line server

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
of the EC2 Instance does fail,

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
then you'll risk to have a dear loss

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
because the hardware attached to the EC2 Instance

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
will fail as well.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So if you do decide to use an EC2 Instance Store,

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
then it is your entire responsibility

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
to make sure that you back it up

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and that you replicate it correctly based on your needs.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So what I mean by better performance,

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
this is just an example to illustrate it,

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
don't need to know it.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But if you look at for example,

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
the Instance size of I3 dot something,

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
there is an Instance Store attached

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to these kinds of instances

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and if you look at the Read IOPS

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and the Write IOPS

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
which correspond to how many I/O operations

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
we can do per second.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Then you can see at some of these random Read IOPS

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and Write IOPS can reach 3.3 million or 1.4 million,

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
for the most performant one.

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And to put this in comparison

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
with an EBS volume of type BP2 for example,

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
you can reach thirty two thousand IOPS.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So this is a lot more.

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But again, it's just to illustrate my point

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
from an exam perspective anytime you see very

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
high performance hardware attached volume

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
for your EC2 Instances, think local EC2 Instance Store.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's it.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I will see you in the next lecture.
