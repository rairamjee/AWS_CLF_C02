1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's do a quick cleanup just to make sure

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
we have a clean slate and that we don't overpay anything

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
even though we are in the free tier.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So if you go to the EC2 Dashboard, you will see all

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the resources running in your region.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So I have two running instances.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm going to open this in new tab.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Four volumes and then four key pairs.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You can leave it as is.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It doesn't cost you any money, no matter what.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Snapshots, I have two so I will open this in new tab.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And then finally, security group.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
As well, it don't cost you any money so I'm going

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to leave them as is.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So for our EC2 instances, you can take them all,

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
right-click, and then terminate them.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
See, this is very easy.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is the cloud.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then for the volumes, we have some root EBS volumes

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that are going to be deleted as we terminate our instances.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But for these two EBS volumes, I'm going to delete them

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
as well manually, okay.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And finally, for the snapshots, I can delete

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the snapshot right away.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So I can take these two things, do action,

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
delete the snapshots, yes.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And then it says this one is not being able to be deleted

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
because it is in use by an AMI.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So I will say okay, go to AMI on the left-hand side.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm going to delete the AMI so I can just deregister it.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I say yes, I want to be deregistering this AMI.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And back into our snapshots, now I'm able to get this one,

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
delete it, and say yes. And now we should be good to go.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So if I look at instances, all terminated.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If I look at EBS volumes, none of them.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And snapshots, empty, and AMI, empty.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, that's it for the cleanup.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to refresh this and as we can see,

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
we are good to go.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
