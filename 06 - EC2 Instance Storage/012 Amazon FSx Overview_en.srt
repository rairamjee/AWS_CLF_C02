1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, so now let's talk about Amazon FSx,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
which is a managed service to get third-party

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
high-performance file systems on AWS.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So in case you don't wanna use EFS or S3,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and you want something else, then you can use FSX

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to manage these file systems.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So you have three offerings today.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You have FSx for Lustre, FSx for Windows File Server,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and FSx for NetApp ONTAP.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And they can add file systems over time

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to the FSx service, I'm pretty sure,

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but they will not update this video

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
unless you need to know about the other ones.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So the two most important ones are going to be

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
FSx for Lustre, and FSx for Windows File Server,

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and this is what is covered in this lesson.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The first one is Amazon FSx for Windows File Server,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
which is a fully managed, highly reliable and scalable

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Windows native shared file system

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
built on Windows File Server.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So this is meant for Windows instances.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So the way you do it is that deploy the FSx

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
usually across two availability zones,

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and then there is support

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
for all the Windows native protocols,

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
such as the SMB protocol and Windows NTFS,

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which allows you to mount this file system

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
onto your Windows machines.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And so if you look at your corporate data center

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and you have a Windows Client, for example,

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
over SMB, it's able to access the Windows file server.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But also if you had EC2 instances that are Windows based,

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and then they could also might as well

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
access this Windows file server.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So Amazon FSx is the way to deploy this Windows file server

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that leverages the SMB protocol and Windows NTFS.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because this is also a Microsoft type of offering,

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
there is integration with Microsoft Active Directory

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
for user security and Windows file server in Amazon FSx

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
can be accessed from AWS directly,

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
or as you can see on this diagram

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
from your on-premises infrastructure.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now, the second flavor of Amazon FSx you have in AWS

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is called Amazon FSx for Lustre.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And you need to remember that this says to have

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
a fully managed, high-performance and scalable file storage

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
for high performance computing.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So whenever you see storage for HPC,

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
so high-performance computing, thinks FSx for Lustre.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why, well Lustre, there is derived from the name

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Linux and cluster, so put together it's Lustre.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And so imagine cluster like processing

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
this kind of things, maybe it's a way for you to remember

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
what Amazon FSx for Lustre is.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This allows you to run a lot of use cases

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
for high performance computing, such as machine learning,

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
analytics, video processing, financial modeling,

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and it scales to extremely high traffics

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
in terms of hundreds of gigabytes per second

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
of data exchanged, millions of IO operations per second,

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
sub milliseconds latency,

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
so it's really a high-performance file system.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So the way it works is that Amazon FSx for Lustre

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
can be connected either to your corporate data center

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
or to your compute instances directly within AWS.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And then in the backend, Amazon FSx for Lustre

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is actually storing your data,

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
possibly onto an Amazon S3 bucket.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So that's it, that's all you need to know for Amazon FSx

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
there is no easy hands-on to do it.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So we'll skip that, but just remember the two flavors

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
of Amazon FSx going into the exam,

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and you should be good to go.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So that's it, I will see you in the next lecture.
