1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's go ahead and practice using AMX.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For this, I'm going to launch an instance,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and I'm going to go into this new experience.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So I will scroll down.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We'll choose Amazon Linux 2.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I will scroll down again.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We'll use the G2 micro.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I will select the easy to draw as my key pair

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but it doesn't really matter.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then I will scroll down.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I would edit the network settings

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and I will select an existing security group

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
being my launch wizard one from before.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then we'll have the same storage and for advanced details,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will scroll down and I will go for user data,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but this time you're going to copy everything,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but the last line.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, in the first four lines, we actually install HTTPD

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
which is the Apache web server.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In the last line, we create an index file

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but right now we don't want to create an index file

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
want to do everything but that to create an AMI out of it.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So we just copy everything.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Remember, the last line is the system CTL command.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And then we launch our instance.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So our instance is launched and what's going to happen is

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that the instance is going to launch that's right here.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And then it's going to run

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
through the EC two, using the script

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and it's going to install the Apache web server.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So if I'm too quick

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and I try to open right now, this public IPV four

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and try to enter into it, as you can see, it doesn't work.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll get a connection, error, refused and so on.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I need to make sure I'm also using the HTTP protocol,

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
of course, but it, it just won't work, right?

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Because you need to give it a bit of time.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Even if it says 'running', you need to give it time

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
for the EC two user data script to run for the first time.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So this might take a minute.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This might take two minutes.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay. But don't be in a rush, just wait for it to be done.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then at some point when you refresh

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
you will see the screen.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So let me pause the video.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And it took about two minutes, but now I have my test page

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and this is the basic page from the Apache web server.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And therefore we are good to go.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So what we're going to do out of it is we're going to

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
create an AMI because we want to just save the state

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
of our EC two instance and reuse that.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So I right click and I will do image and templates

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and then I will create an image.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So we'll call this one 'demo image'

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and we're going to create our own AMI.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And then we have these settings right here.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We'll just leave it as is.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Go here and click on create image.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So now what's going to happen is that

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
an AMI is going to be created.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So if I go to the left-hand side and click on AMI's,

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
as we can see here, my demo AMI is registered.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And right now the status is pending

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
because it is being created.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So what I need to do is to be a little bit patient and

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
for it to go into the created state.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So my Amazon AMI is now created.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And what I can do now is I can launch instances

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
from this AMI by clicking here.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Or if you are in the instance creation page,

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
we can launch instances.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And this one is called 'From AMI'.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And in here in the quick start

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
we get access to the ones we know

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
but you can also go into the 'my AMI's tab'.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay. And you have the ones owned by me

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and you can choose the demo image that you just created

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
from before.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So in that case, you scroll down, you select

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
to key pair or not, just up to you.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Network settings, again,

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
we edit them and we just select the existing launchers

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
in one security group.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And what I'm going to do is that in the advanced,

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
at the very bottom, I'm going to enter some user data.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So I copy the first three lines, okay.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Which are starting with the hash.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And then the last line, which is the echo on the new line.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And so what we do is that we only just write a new file.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So we don't need to reinstall HTTPD

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
because this AMI already contains HTTPD

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
which is why we will speed up in the boot up time.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is why you would create an AMI.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So we launch an instance and now the instance is launched.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So I can just click on it.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is the one from the AMI.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I need to wait for it to be fully created.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
My instance from my AMI is now running.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I take the public IP address

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and then I see the 'Hello World' from this.

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And as you can see, this was much quicker

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
because we didn't have to install HTTPD again.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So this is the whole power of AMI's.

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And you can imagine, well, it could be just more than that.

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It could be security software,

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
a lot of prerequisite software, and so on,

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you install it, it maybe it takes two,

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
three minutes to do it.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Then you package it as an AMI,

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and then you just start from the AMI,

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
maybe do some end customization at the end

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
but you have a much faster boot-up.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And you're good to go.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So that's it for this demo.

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Now to get back from this

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
what you do is that you take your two instances

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and you can terminate them.

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And that's it.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I will see you in the next lecture.
