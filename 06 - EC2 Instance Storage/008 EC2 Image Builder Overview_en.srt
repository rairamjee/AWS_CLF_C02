00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, so let's talk about

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
a new service that I really like

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and that does come up in the exam now.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It is called EC2 Image Builder.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It is used to automate the creation

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
of virtual machines or container images.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Quickly, what does that mean for the exam?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That means that you're gonna be able with EC2 Image Builder

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to automate the creation, maintain,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
validate and test AMIs for EC2 instances.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's have a look at diagram

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to see how that works in detail.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So we have the EC2 Image Builder service

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and it is automatically, when it's going to run,

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
it is going to create an EC2 instance

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
called a Builder EC2 instance,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and that EC2 instance is going to build components

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and customize the software, for example,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
install Java, update the CLI,

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
update the software system, maybe install firewalls,

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
whatever you define to happen on that EC2 instance,

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
maybe install your application.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And then once this is done,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
then an AMI is going to be created out of that EC2 instance,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but all of this is obviously automated.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then the AMI is created, but we want to validate it.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So EC2 Image Builder will automatically create

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
a test EC2 instance from that AMI

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and going to run a bunch of tests

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
that you are defining in advance.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And if you don't wanna run any tests,

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
obviously you can just skip that test,

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but the test can be asking,

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
is the AMI working, is it secure?

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is my application running correctly?

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All these kinds of things.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And then once the AMI is tested,

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
then the AMI is going to be distributed.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So while EC2 Image Builder is original service,

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
it is possible for you to take that AMI

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and distribute it to multiple regions,

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
therefor allowing your application

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and your workflow to be truly global.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Next, EC2 Image Builder can be run on a schedule.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So you can define a weekly schedule

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
or you can say you can run whenever packages are updated

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
or you can run it manually, et cetera, et cetera.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And it is a free service,

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
so you're only going to pay for the underlying resources.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What does that mean?

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, that means that if you create

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
an EC2 instance during this process

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and EC2 Image Builder will create these EC2 instances,

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
then you're going to pay for these EC2 instances

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and when the AMI is created and distributed,

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
you're going to pay for the storage of that AMI

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
wherever it has been created

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and wherever it has been distributed,

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
but that should make sense, right?

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I will see you in the next lecture.
