00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Welcome to this section

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
where we will at look the different storage options

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
for EC2 instances.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So first, the most important ones

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
are going to be EBS Volumes, so let's define what they are.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
An EBS Volume stands for Elastic Block Store.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's a network drive that you can attach to your instances

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
while they run,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we've been using them without even knowing.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So this EBS Volumes allow us to persist data,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
even after the instance is terminated.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And so that's the whole purpose,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we can recreate an instance

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and mount to the same EBS Volume from before

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we'll get back our data.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That is very helpful.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So these EBS Volumes, at the CCP level,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
can only be mounted to one instance at a time, okay?

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And when you create an EBS Volume,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
it is bound to a specific availability zone.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That means that you cannot have an EBS Volume

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
in created, for example, us-east-1a

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
we'll see this in the diagram in a second.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So how do you think of EBS Volumes?

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, you can think of them as network USB sticks.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So, it's a USB stick that you can take from a computer

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and put it in another computer

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
but you actually don't physically put it in a computer.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's attached through the network.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The feature gives us 30 GBs of free EBS storage

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
of type General Purpose or SSD or Magnetic per month.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And in this course, we'll be using this

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
with the GP2 to GP3 Volumes.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now let's look at it.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So EBS Volumes are network drivers

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that is not a physical drive, okay?

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So to communicate between the instance and the EBS Volume,

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
it will be using the network.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And because the network is used,

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
there may be a bit of latency from one computer

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to reach to another server.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now, EBS Volumes, because they are a network drive

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
they can be detached from an EC2 instance

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and attached to another one very quickly.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And that's makes it super handy

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
when you want to do failovers for example.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
EBS Volumes are locked to a specific availability zones,

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that means that, as I said, if it's created in us-east-1a

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
it cannot be attached to us-east-1b

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but, we will see in this section that if we do a snapshot,

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
then we are able to move a volume across

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
from different availability zones.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And finally, it's a volume,

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
so you have to provision capacity in advance.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So you need to say how many GBs you want in advance

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and the IOPS, which is I/O operations per seconds,

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and you're basically defining how you want

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
your EBS Volume to perform.

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're going to get billed for that provision capacity

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and you can increase the capacity over time

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
if you want you to have better performance or more size.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, as a diagram, how does it look like?

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, we have us-east-1a with one EC2 instance

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and we can attach, for example

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
one EBS Volume to the EC2 instance.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If we create another EC2 instance,

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
as I said an EBS Volume can not be attached to two instances

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
at a time at the Certified Cloud Practitioner level.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And therefore, what I wanna say is that

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
this other EC2 instance needs to have

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
its own EBS Volume attached to it,

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but it is a very possible for us to have two EBS Volumes

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
attached to one instance

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
think of it as two network USB sticks into one machine

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that makes a lot of sense.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now EBS Volumes are linked to an availability zone.

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So as we can see, all this diagram has been so far using

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
us-east-1a.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So if you want it to have other EBS Volumes in an other AZ

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
then you would need to create this separately

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
in the other availability zone.

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So just same way that's your EC2 instances

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
are bound to an AZ, so are the EBS Volumes.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Finally, it is possible for us to create EBS Volumes

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and leave them unattached

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
they don't need to be necessarily attached

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
to an ECG instance, they can be attached on demand

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and that makes it very, very powerful.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Finally, when we go ahead and create EBS Volumes

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
through EC2 instances, there is this thing

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
called a Deletes on Termination attribute

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and this can come up in the exam so,

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
if you look at this when we create

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
an EBS Volume in the console, when we create an EC2 instance

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
there is the second to last column

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
called Delete on Termination.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And by default, it is ticked for the Root Volume

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and not ticked for a new EBS Volume.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So this controls the EBS behavior

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
when an EC2 instance is being terminated.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So by default, as we can see, the root EBS Volume

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
is deleted alongside the instance being terminated.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So it's enabled

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and the default any other attached EBS Volume is not deleted

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
because it's disabled by default.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But obviously as we can see in this UI, we can control

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
if you want to enable or disable delete on termination.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And so use case right, would be for example,

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
if you want to preserve the root volume,

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
when an instance is terminated,

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
for example, to save some data

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
then you can disable delete on termination

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
for the root volume, and you'll be good to go

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and it could be an exam scenario at the exam.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I hope you liked it.

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
