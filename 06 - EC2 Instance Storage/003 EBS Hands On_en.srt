1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So let's have a look

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
at the EBS volumes attached to our instance.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So if you click on instance

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and then you go to the storage tab in here,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
you find that there is a root device

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and there's a block device on it.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As you can see, we got one volume

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
of eight gigabytes currently attached

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
into our EC2 instance.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So what I can do is I can click on this volume

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and it will take me into the volumes interface of AWS.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And we can see that, yes, indeed,

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
our volume exists and it's there.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's in use as shown here

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and it's attached to an instance right here.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So we have a different kind of console here

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and to access it, you can just go on the left hand side

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and click on volumes.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So as we can see, now we have one EBS of eight gigabytes

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and what I can do is I can create a second volume.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So let me create a volume

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and I will have many options to choose from,

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
GP2, GP3 and so on

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but I will just use GP2 of type of size two gigabytes.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And then for availability zone,

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I can choose the same one where my EC2 instance is.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So for this, I'm gonna go into my EC2 instance, in here

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and I will find which availability zone it is on.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So I scroll down,

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and it is going to be in the networking one.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I scroll down in the networking

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and here, availability zone, it says eu-west-1b.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Therefore, the volume I will create

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
is going to be in eu-west-1b

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
because the EBS volumes are bound by specific AZ.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So that's good.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I will have it done and create this volume.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And now my volume is created.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And what I can do is if I can click on it,

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
this one is currently not attached.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, so it's been creating

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
so let me refresh this to see if it's created.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, it's available and it's not attached yet.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So therefore, because it's available,

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
what I can do is action

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and then I can attach the volume

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and we need to find an instance.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So we have one running right here.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And so we're going to attach this volume to my instance,

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
click on attach volume and voila,

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
our instance now has two EBS volumes attached to it.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How do we know?

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, I can refresh this page,

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
go to storage on my EC2 console, scroll down.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
As you can see now for block devices,

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have two block devices.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have the one of eight gigabytes

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and the one of two gigabytes.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
To actually use this new block device,

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
it's a bit more complicated

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and out of scope for this course,

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
but you can go to format EBS volume attach EC2,

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and you should find something like, yes,

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
make an Amazon EBS volume available to use on Linux

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and this gives you instructions on how to do it

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but again, this is out of scope for this.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So now if I go into my volumes and I create a volume,

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I can create a volume of two gigabytes of GP2

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but this time the AZ is going to be eu-west-1a

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and not eu-west-1b.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So it's gonna be a different AZ

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
than the one of my EC2 instance.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And the reason I do so is to show you

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that right now, we have three GP2 volumes.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So let me refresh this.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So the last one is available and it's a different AZ,

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
so eu-west-1a.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And if I do actions and then attach volume,

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
as you can see, I cannot attach it to my EC2 instance

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
because my EC2 instance is in eu-west-1b.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And so therefore, we can see that the EBS volumes

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
indeed are bound by a specific availability zone.

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Lastly, what I can do is that I can take this volume,

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
do action, delete volume, and it's gone.

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And that really shows you the power of the cloud.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can just request volumes, delete volumes

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
right on the go in the matters of seconds.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, so we have our two EBS volumes in here

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and what I wanna show you now is a cool behavior.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So what happens if I terminate my instance?

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Well remember, and I will show you again,

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
this one root volume of eight gigabytes

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
has the delete on termination attribute.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So how do we know?

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, if I go into my storage

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and then go to my block devices, into this table right here,

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and scroll all the way right,

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you see the first one has delete on termination yes

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and the second one no.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So why this one is yes?

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, I don't know if you remember,

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
but when you go through the process

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
of launching an instance, okay?

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And then you scroll down to the storage,

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
in here, if you click on advanced,

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
you can see the fact

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that it is your roots of eight gigabytes

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and by default, this delete on termination attribute is yes,

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
which makes sense, but you could set it to no

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
if you wanted to keep the root

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
after terminating your instance.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So this explains why we see from before,

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the yes in this table.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And so therefore, if I go ahead and terminate my instance

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
which I will, so it says successfully terminated

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
so it's going to really remove it from here.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I can go back into my EBS volumes.

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can refresh them.

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And what's going to happen is that this one

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
soon is going to be available

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
so because it's going to be detached from my EC2 instance

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and then it's going to be terminated.

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I'm going to pause until this is done.

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And here we go.

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So my eight gigabyte volume has now disappeared.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Only my two gigabyte volume is left

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and if I go to my EC2 console,

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
well, it says that my first instance has been terminated.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So that's it for this lecture.

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I hope you liked it

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
