1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Now let's talk about

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
what powers our EC2 instances which is an AMI,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so AMI stands for Amazon machine image

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and they represent a customization of an EC2 instance.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So you can use AMIs you created by AWS

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
or you can customize it into your own and what is in an AMI?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well we have our own software configuration,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we can define and set up the operating system,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we can set up any monitoring tool

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and if we create our own AMI

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we're going to get a faster boot time and configuration time

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
because all the software that we want to install

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
onto our EC2 instance

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is going to be prepackaged through the AMI.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So we have to build our own AMIs

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and they can be built for a specific region

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and then they can be copied across region

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
if we wanted to use it

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and leverage the AWS global infrastructure.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So we can launch EC2 instances from different kind of AMIs.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What we've been doing so far in this course

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
is to use a public AMI and these are provided by AWS.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So the Amazon Linux 2 AMI is a very popular AMI for AWS

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and it was provided by AWS themselves

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but we can create our own AMI

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
then therefore you have to make and maintain them yourself

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
there are tools obviously to automate this

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but this is a task that you have to do as a cloud user

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
or finally you can launch an EC2 instance

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
from an AWS Marketplace AMI

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
which is an AMI that has been made by someone else

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and potentially sold by someone else

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so it is quite common to have vendors on AWS

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
to create their own AMIs or their own software

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
with a nice configuration and so on

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and then they will sell it through the marketplace AMI

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
for you to buy it and to save some time.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And even you as a user you could create a business

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
of selling AMIs on the AWS marketplace,

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
this is something that some businesses do.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay so the AMI process from an EC2 instance,

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
how does it work?

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well we'll start an EC2 instance and we'll customize it.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then we will stop the instance

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
to make sure the data integrity is correct,

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
then we can build an AMI from it

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
so this will also create EBS snapshots behind the scenes

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and then finally we can launch instances from other AMIs

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
so this is what we'll be doing

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
in the demo and the next lecture.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So we have US-EAST-1A,

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and we can create the same instance as US-EAST-1B,

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so the process is we launch the instance in US-EAST-1A,

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
we're going to customize it

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
then we're going to create an AMI from it

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
this will be our custom AMI.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And then in US-EAST-1B

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
we will be able to launch from that AMI

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and we'll effectively create a copy of our EC2 instance.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So I hope you're excited

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
