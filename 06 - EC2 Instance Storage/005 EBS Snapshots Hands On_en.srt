1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So we have this two gigabyte,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
GP2 EBS Volume available to us,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and we can take a snapshot from it.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So if we do Actions, we can Create a snapshot.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So we can add a Description, for example, DemoSnapshots,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and then click on Create snapshots.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So then on the left hand side menu,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
instead of Volumes, you can click on Snapshots.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And Snapshots shows you a list

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
of all the snapshots you have.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And as you can see, we have one right here.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is Completed.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It is 100% Available.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And we get some information around the snapshot itself.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
For first of all, what we can do is that we can Copy

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
this snapshot into other region.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So if you right click and do Copy Snapshots,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then as you can see, you can copy the snapshot

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
into any destination region that you want.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And this can come in very handy,

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in case you want for example,

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to have a Disaster Recovery Strategy,

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to make sure data is backed up in another region of AWS.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So I won't do that, I won't do so, but you get the idea.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Another thing I can do is take the Snapshot,

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and I can recreate a Volume from it.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So Action, Create volume from snapshots.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And we choose a two gigabytes GP2 Volume.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And then the target AZ doesn't have to remain eu-west-1a,

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
it can be, for example, eu-west-1b.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And we can also encrypt these volumes if you wanted to

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and add some Tags.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And so as we can see, when we click on Create volume,

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
what's going to happen is that if we go back

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
into our Volumes,

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
well, now we have two Volumes, as you can see.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And one of them,

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
this one was restored through a Snapshots, okay?

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And it is an eu-west-1b.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So the idea is that thanks to Snapshots,

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we can quote unquote copy EBS volumes

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
across different Availability Zones.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And that's very handy.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If we look again at Snapshots, we can have a look

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
at what's called the Recycle Bin.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So the Recycle Bin is a way for you to protect

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
your EBS Snapshots from accidental deletion,

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
as well as your Amazon Machine Images.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So we can Create a Retention Rule and name it

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
DemoRetentionRule.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will select EBS Snapshots.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will Apply to all resources and retain them

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
during one day.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And for Rule Lock Setting, I will leave this unlocked,

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
so that I can delete this rule whenever I want to.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And then click on Create Retention Rule.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And now on the Resources, we can see if we have Resources

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
in the Recycle Bin.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So let's go back into our Snapshots in the EC2 Console.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So I'm going to go into EC2.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Here we go, Snapshots.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Little shortcuts.

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And what I'm going to do is take the Snapshots,

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and first, before I delete it,

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I wanna show you the Storage Tiers.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So right now it is a Standard Storage Tier, okay?

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But you can move the Storage Tier,

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
by Archiving a snapshots,

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and so I need to move the Storage Tier

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
into another Pricing Level.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But if you want to restore it,

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
of course, you will have to wait 24 to 72 hours.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So just to show you.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But anyway, let's go ahead and delete the snapshot.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So we'll delete the Snapshots.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
As you can see, it's gone.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And before, it used to completely delete the snapshots,

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and you couldn't recover it, okay?

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
As you can see, it's gone.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But now thanks to the Recycle Bin,

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
well, if I refresh here my Resources,

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can now see that my Snapshot has appeared here.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And what I can do is click on it and Recover it.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, Recover Resources, and voila, it's back

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
into my Snapshots on my EC2 console.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay, that was pretty awesome, right?

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, that's it for EBS Snapshots.

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
