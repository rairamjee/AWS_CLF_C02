1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now let's talk about EBS snapshots.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So you can take your EBS volumes and make a snapshot,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is also called a backup,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
at any point of time that you wanted to.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The idea is that you will be able

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to back up the state of it,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and even if the EBS volume is terminated later on,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
you could restore it from that backup.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now to make a backup, it is not necessary

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to detach the volume prior to doing the backup,

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but it is recommended just to make sure

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that everything is clean on your EBS volume.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And why do we do snapshots?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, we can obviously restore them

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but we can also copy snapshots

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
across availability zones or regions,

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and the idea is that you would be able to transfer

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
some of your data in a different region on AWS

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to leverage the global infrastructure.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So if we look at US-EAST-1A,

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and we want to transfer an EBS volume to US-EAST-1B,

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the way we do it is that we would have the EBS volume

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
attached to the EC2 instance, and then we would snapshot it.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So maybe we would stop the EC2 instance ahead of time

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to make sure the snapshot is clean

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
or we could just do it on the fly.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It is really up to you and based on how you have programmed

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
your EC2 instance.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now the EBS snapshots exist in your region.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And that EBS snapshot can be used

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
to restore a new EBS volume in another availability zone.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And then now that this is done,

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
we can attach the new EBS volume

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to an EC2 instance in US-EAST-1B.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And there we go.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We have successfully and effectively transferred

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
an EBS volume through a snapshot across AZ.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So some features need to know about for EBS Snapshots

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
is the first one, an EBS snapshot archive.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So it allows you to move your snapshots

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
to another storage tier called an archive tier,

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and that tier is 75% cheaper.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So your snapshot is going to be moved,

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
you know, manually or whatever, however you set

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to the archive tier.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But if you have it in the archive,

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
it takes you between 24 to 72 hours

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to restore from the archive.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So these are for snapshot

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that are not very important to you

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
to restore it in a rush, okay,

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
but you wanna save some cost on them.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The second feature is around recycle bin for EBS snapshots.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So by default, when you delete snapshots, they're gone.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But you can set up a recycle bin,

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and the recycle bin will have all the snapshots

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
that are deleted.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And then after a while, maybe you can specify

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
from one day to one year,

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
the snapshots are gone from the bin.

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So on deleting the snapshots, it would go into recycle bin.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And you may have, for example, one year

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to recover the snapshots, which allows you

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
to protect yourself against accidental deletion.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's it for this lecture.

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I hope you liked it

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
