1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's summarize what we have learned in this section.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The first one around the EBS volumes,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
they are network drives that are attached

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to one EC2 instance at a time.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They're mapped to a specific Availability Zone

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we can use the EBS snapshot feature to do backups

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
or to be able to transfer the data from one EBS volume

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
across to an other Availability Zone.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We've seen about AMIs.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There are ready to use EC2 instances images, with

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the customizations we want.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And if we want to automate the process of building an AMI

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we can use the EC2 image builder service to

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
automatically build tests and distribute AMIs.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We've seen EC2 instance store, which is a way

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
for us to have a very high performance hardware disc

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
this time, attached to our EC2 instance.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But it is lost

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in case our instances stopped or terminated.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If we wanted to have a network file system,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we would use the EFS service.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
With EFS service,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
we can get a NFS that we can attach

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to hundreds of instances within the region.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So there is no AZ luck,

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
now it's at the region level.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And if you want to cost-optimize our EFS service,

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we could use EFS-IA,

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which allows us to move the files that are infrequently used

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
into a lower cost tier.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Finally, we've seen about FSx, FSx for Windows,

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which is a way for us to get a network file system

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
for Windows servers

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and FSx for Luster, which is

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
for us to perform high performance computing.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So HPC on a Linux file system.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So to say for this section, I hope you liked it

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and that I will see you in the next section.
