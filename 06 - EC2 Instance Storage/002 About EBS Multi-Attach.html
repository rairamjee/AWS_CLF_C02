<h4><strong>About EBS&nbsp;Multi-Attach</strong></h4><p>While I&nbsp;say that in the previous lecture that EBS&nbsp;volumes cannot be attached to multiple instances, I&nbsp;know it is not true for io1 and io2 volume types:&nbsp;this is called the EBS&nbsp;Multi-Attach feature. </p><p><strong>From an AWS&nbsp;Cloud Practitioner exam perspective this out of scope for the exam.</strong> <br>In order to keep the course simple and accessible, I&nbsp;have left out this feature from the course. </p><p>If you are curious to learn about EBS&nbsp;Multi-Attach, you will find it in the AWS&nbsp;Certified Solutions&nbsp;Architect Associate course, or in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes-multi.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AWS documentation</a>.</p><p><strong>Happy learning!</strong></p>
