00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi, so I just won't talk to you

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
about the UI changes that you may see

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
between my videos and AWS.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So just to explain things to you,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
AWS is doing a huge transition of their interface

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to a new guidelines for design.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And so in that regards, sometimes the UI will look new

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and this is what I call a new type of UI

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and it looks like pretty square and so on,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but sometimes you will have the old kind of UIs,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which looks like this.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And so AWS is doing a transition for all their services,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
of all their UIs and it's not all at the same time.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It happens over one year or two years

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and it's still happening today.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So my goal is obviously to have videos

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
as updated as possible, but it is literally impossible

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to keep up with all the changes

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
until they're done with them.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So what I'm doing is that I try my best to keep my videos

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
up to date if they are breaking changes,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but if I believe that the changes are minor enough

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that you can find your way around the console,

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will not update the video just yet, but trust me,

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I do listen to feedback

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and whenever a video is outdated,

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will go ahead and update it.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Another thing you can do is that if you really are lost,

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
you can switch a toggle in most of the services

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that have a new experience and switch back to the old UI.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If you do switch back to the old UI like here

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
as you can see, you will see the old UI sometimes

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
like you see in my videos, but really I just wanted

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to give you a little warning just to explain to you

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the course is not outdated.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It is my passion and my duty to make sure

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that you pass your exam and learn a lot in this course

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and so trust me, I am monitoring every single day

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
for updates and changes that are breaking my course

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and if they do break my course,

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I promise that I will update my videos, but please, please,

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
please forgive me in advance

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
if the video doesn't look as updated as the UI in AWS,

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
it is very difficult right now

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to keep up with their changes.

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So thank you so much and I wish you a very happy learning.
