1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now let's talk about cloud computing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So what is cloud computing?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The definition is as such,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
database storage, application, and other IT resources.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The very important keyword here is on-demand,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you get it when you need it.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And then through a cloud service platform,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you're going to get a pay-as-you-go pricing.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That means that you're only going to pay

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
for what you requested when you requested it

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and as you're using it, when you're done using it,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
you're not going to pay anymore.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is a big shift, right?

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Then this is cloud computing.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So we can provision exactly the right type

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and size of computing resources you need.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Do you need a big server? We have that for you.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Do you want a small one? We have that too.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Do you want 10? Yes.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Do you want two tomorrow? Of course.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The cloud really allows you to adapt

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
to the type and size you need.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then you can access all these resources,

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
not with 24-hour notice, not with two hours notice,

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but instantly, you don't need to order things in advance.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
When you want a server, and you'll see this in this course,

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
you'll have it within seconds.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Then the cloud will also give you a really nice interface

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
so you can easily access your servers, your storage,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
databases, and a set of application services.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Something about the cloud, but in specific AWS,

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
which is Amazon Web Services owns and maintains

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the network-connected hardware required

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
for these application services while you provision and use

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
what you need via a web application.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So with this interface,

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
we'll make all these things a reality.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now, let's go back to our traditional IT.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So we're changing.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We have our office or our garage,

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but now instead of building our own data center

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
we're going to use the cloud, and in the cloud,

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
which is also a data center, is just not our data center,

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
we're going to have servers one, two, three, as we need

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and as we go and we're just going to pay for exactly

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
what we're using.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So you have actually been using the cloud without

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
even knowing it because it is omnipresent,

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
but not necessarily visible.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So if you use a web client such as Gmail,

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
well, for example, it's an email cloud service

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and you're going to pay only for the emails you stored.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're not provisioning servers when you use Gmail,

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
you just use it.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Maybe you've stored some data on the cloud,

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
maybe through Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos,

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
iCloud, I don't know.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But with Dropbox, for example, it's a cloud store service,

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
you're going to put your files on Dropbox.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And originally, fun fact, Dropbox was built on AWS.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So we've been using a cloud storage service as well

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
without knowing it.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And Netflix, it's huge.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It is built entirely on AWS and it provides you

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
a cloud service, which is to get video on-demand.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now, obviously these cloud services are very different

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
from AWS, but we'll learn what it goes behind these services

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and how AWS can help you build

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
these kinds of cloud services.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So let's go one step further.

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There are different kinds of clouds out there.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The first one is called a private cloud and the provider is,

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
could be Rackspace.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is cloud services used by a single organization,

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
they're not exposed to the public,

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
so you get your own private cloud,

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
your own private data center,

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
it's just managed by someone else.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You still have complete control over it

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and you have more security for a sensitive application,

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
which may need some specific business needs.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is out of scope for this course,

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but still good to mention.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now the public cloud is more interesting.

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So three famous cloud providers that are public,

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
are Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
that we'll be learning in this course, obviously.

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So in this case, the cloud resources own and operated

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
by a third party cloud service provider

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and they're delivered over the Internet

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and we'll see the six advantages of using cloud computing.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So in this instance, that means that from AWS,

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
we'll be able to request what we need when we want it.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And then lastly, which is also important for the exam

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
is the concept of a hybrid cloud.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So with hybrid, we're actually getting the mix

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
of private and public.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We're going to keep some servers on premises and we'll

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
extend some of the capabilities we need into the cloud.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That means that we'll have a hybrid of our own

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
infrastructure and the AWS cloud.

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We'll have control over sensitive assets

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
in your private infrastructure,

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but we'll have the flexibility and the cost effectiveness

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
of using the public cloud.

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Now, five characteristics of cloud computing.

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The first one is that it's fully on-demand and self service.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Users, and we'll see this in this course,

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
we will be able to provision resources

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and use them without having anyone from AWS intervene.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Then we'll be having access to a broad network,

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the resources will be available over the network,

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and it can be accessed in diverse ways

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
as we'll see in this course.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It'll be multi-tenancy and we'll have resource pooling.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So that means that not just us, but other customers

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
from AWS can share the same infrastructure

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and applications while still having security and privacy.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And then these multiple customers are getting serviced

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
from the same physical resources.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So here, me, you, and other customers,

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
we're going to share this entire data center of the cloud.

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This gives us rapid elasticity and scalability.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That means that we can automatically and quickly acquire

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and dispose resources when we need.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And that means that we can quickly

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and easily scale based on demand.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And that is a major advantage of the cloud.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Finally, it's a measured service, so the usage is going

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
to be measured and we're going to pay exactly

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
for what we have used.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is a big shift from on premises.

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Now, six advantages.

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We're going to trade capital expenses

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
for operational expenses, so CAPEX or OPEX.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That means that you don't own hardware,

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
you're going to pay on-demand and that will reduce

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
your total cost of ownership, your TCO,

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and your operational expense.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That means that you don't buy the hardware in advance,

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
you're just going to rent it from AWS.

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then we're going to benefit from massive economies of scale.

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The price is because we are using AWS, not just us,

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
but other customers and so many people are using it,

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
then the prices will be reduced by AWS over time because AWS

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
will be more efficient at running due to its large scale.

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We also need to stop guessing capacity.

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Before we had to plan and buy servers in advance

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and hope that it would meet the capacity,

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
but now we can actually scale automatically

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
based on the actual measured usage for our application.

153
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And because everything's on-demand,

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
we have increased speed and agility.

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We can create, operate and do stuff right away,

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
no blockers for us to be efficient.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And finally, we have a huge cost that we don't need

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
to have anymore, which is we can stop spending money running

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and maintaining data centers.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And this allows a team of say five people

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
to create a global application in minutes,

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
thanks to leveraging this AWS global infrastructure

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
that is going to be worldwide.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay. So the problems we've just solved by using the cloud

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
is that we're more flexible, we're more cost effective,

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
we are more scalable because we can add resources

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
as we need to go along,

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
we're elastic, we can scale out and scale-in when needed,

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
we also have high availability and fault tolerance

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
because we don't really on the one data center,

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
we rely on the fleet of data centers all around the world.

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We're more agile, we can rapidly develop,

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
test and launch software applications,

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and although this make the cloud a really no brainer.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So that's it, just for an introduction of how the cloud

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
is going to be effective.

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
