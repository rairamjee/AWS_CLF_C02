1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So welcome to the AWS Console Home.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And in this page, you can do a lot of things.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So first of all, let's have a look

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
at the top right corner of your screen,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
right now, this is what's called the regions selector,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and right now I am in Northern Virginia,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
US east one.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But it is advised for this course to

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
choose a region that is geographically close to you.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So because I'm in Europe, I'm actually close to Ireland.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I can choose EU west one.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But if you are in other regions of the world, for example

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
if you're in Africa and you're close to Capetown

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
then choose this.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Of course you don't have to physically be

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
in that region to use that region, okay?

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You can for example

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
choose whatever region makes sense for you.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So choose whatever is closest

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and this will give you the lowest amount of latency.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Next in the console console, you will see a list

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
of recently visited services

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and it should be empty for you.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I just tried that one

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
so it's showing one right here for me.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
On the bottom you get some information about AWS.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You get the health issues, if need be

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and cost and usage info for your accounts

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
as well as tutorials to build a solution and so on.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So this webpage is actually changing a lot over timeless

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
changed a lot for the past two years.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And so it may not look exactly the same as you

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and in case it looks very, very, very different.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I will rerecord this lecture.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, so once we have this

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
we need to look at services of AWS.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And for this two options,

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
the first one is to go on the top left click on services

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and you can either look at services

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
by alphabetical order, as you can see

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
there are a lot of services on AWS,

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
or by category for example, for compute

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
you will have all these services and so on.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But don't worry over time,

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
we will learn these services

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and we don't have to navigate that page.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Another thing I really like is the search bar.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So you can actually type a service for example, route 53

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and then it gives you search results.

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So it gives you four services that match this query, okay?

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then within these services,

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
we can also have a look at features

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and 13 features match them.

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So we can directly jump into the domain names

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
of the route 53 service and it's a good thing.

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We can also look at blogs, knowledge articles

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
documentations and so on.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So this is quite cool.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's go into route 53 now to have a look at this console.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So this one is very special because

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
on the top right hand side, it says global.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That means that this console

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
does not require a region selection.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And that is more of the exception than the rule,

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but some services in AWS are where

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
it's called global services and no matter where you are

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
you're going to get the same view.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But if you switch services and you go, for example

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
to the EC two service,

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
this time on the top right hand side,

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
as you can see it says Ireland

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
because I chose the Ireland region.

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And so based if I run this console in Ireland

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
or say in another region, for example, in Canada,

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
well my view is going to be different

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
in terms of the resources that I will see.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So that's why it's important for you to remain

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
within the same region for the entire duration

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
of this tutorial and this course.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The other thing you can look at

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
is called the AWS global infrastructure

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
that you can find on Google.

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And this gives you a lot

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
of information around your services.

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And one thing that is very important to look at

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
is the AWS regional services.

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And it gives you the services list by region.

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And so this is table,

89
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and so for example, if in the course,

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I talk about a service and do a hands on,

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
but it doesn't seem to be in your region,

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you can check here and find the availability of services.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So for example, we can check a look,

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
have a look for Cape town

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and see the services that are available in this region.

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And if you don't see a service

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
maybe you need to switch a region

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
in of course the console,

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to have access to it

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
because not all the services from AWS are in every region.

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So that's it for this lecture,

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I hope you liked it

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
