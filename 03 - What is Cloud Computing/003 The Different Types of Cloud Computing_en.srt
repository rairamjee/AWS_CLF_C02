1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
As we will see in this course,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
there are different types of cloud computing

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and it is important for us to be able to recognize them.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The first one is called Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is to provide the building blocks for cloud IT.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
With this IAAS, we're going to provide networking,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
computers and data storage space in its raw form.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And using these building blocks, (indistinct)

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
building LEGOs,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're going to be given a very high level of flexibility

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and we can easily understand

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
how we can migrate from traditional on-premises IT

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to the cloud.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Then we're gonna get platform as a service.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In this, we're going to remove the need

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
for your organization

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to manage the underlying infrastructure,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and you can just focus on the deployment

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and management of your applications.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And then one step even further is software

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
as a service or SaaS.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is a completed product that is going to be run

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and managed by the service provider.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So if you wanna compare all these things, well,

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
let's look at an example.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
On premises, you're going to manage everything.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So your applications, your data, your runtime,

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
your middleware, the operating system, virtualization,

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
servers, storage and networking.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And that's a lot.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
With IaaS, so infrastructure as a service, we're going

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
to manage the application, the data, the runtime,

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
the malware, and the OS.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But all the virtualization servers, storage

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and networking are going to be managed by others.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And in our case, AWS.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
With platform as a service, we manage even less.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So everything from the runtime

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
to the networking is managed by AWS.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And the only thing we care about when we use a platform

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
as a service is our application and our data.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And finally, well, if you're using software as a service,

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
everything is going to be managed by AWS.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So well, how does it translate?

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, with IaaS, we can use Amazon EC2 on AWS,

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
but we have other services, such as Google Cloud,

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean and Linode,

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
which will provide us a cloud computing infrastructure

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
as a service.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Platform as a service also exists on AWS

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
with Elastic Beanstalk.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And we'll see all the services obviously in this course.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And outside of AWS, we have Heroku, Google App Engine,

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and Windows Azure.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
For software as a service,

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
we'll also have this on AWS that represents many services

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
of AWS, for example, Rekognition where we want

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
to do some machine learning,

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
but we've been using it as well in the real world

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
with Google Apps, such as Gmail or Dropbox

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
or Zoom for your meetings.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So the Cloud has different flavors,

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
but one thing is common

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
is that the pricing is very different from what you know.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
AWS has three pricing fundamentals

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and it will follow the pay-as-you-go pricing model.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So for the compute, and that represents various services,

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
we're going to pay for the exact compute time.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
For the storage, we're going to pay for the exact amount

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
of data stored in the cloud.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And for the networking, we're going

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to only pay when the data leaves the cloud.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Any data that goes into the cloud is free.

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And this solves the expensive issue of traditional IT

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
because now we only pay exactly what we need.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And so we have huge cost savings ahead of us.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So that's it for this lecture.

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In the next lecture, we'll be having a deeper dive on AWS.
