1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Now let's look at the history

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
of the AWS Cloud.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It was launched in 2002 internally at amazon.com

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
because they realized that the IT departments

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
could be externalized.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Their Amazon infrastructure was one of their core strengths

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and they said, you know what?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
"Maybe we can do IT for someone else, for other people."

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So they launched their first offering publicly,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which was SQS in 2004.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In 2006, they expanded their offering

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and they relaunched with the availability of SQS S3 and EC2.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Don't worry, we'll see all these services in this course.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Then they expanded and said, you know what?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
"We don't have to be just in America.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We could be in Europe."

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And then fast forward to today, we have so many applications

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that used to run, or are still running on AWS,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
such as Dropbox, Netflix, Airbnb, or even the NASA.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now let's look at where AWS is today.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you look at the Magic Quadrant from Gartner,

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you can see that AWS is a leader,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and it has been the case for many, many years.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
AWS now has $90 billion in revenue as of 2023,

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and it accounts for about 31% of the market in Q1 2024,

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
with Microsoft being second with 25%.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's been a pioneer and a leader of the market

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
for 13th consecutive years,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and it has over 1 million active users.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, learning AWS really sets you up

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
for success in the cloud world.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What can you build on AWS?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, pretty much everything.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
AWS will enable you to build sophisticated

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and scalable applications,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and they are applicable to a diverse set of industries.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Every company has a use case for the cloud.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Netflix, McDonald's, 21st Century Fox, Activision,

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
they're all using the cloud.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And use cases can include

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
just transferring your enterprise IT,

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
or using the cloud as a backup and storage,

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
or doing some big data analytics.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You can also host a website,

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
or create a backend for your mobile

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and your social applications,

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
or you can have your entire gaming servers

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
running on the cloud.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The applications are endless.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Now, AWS is global,

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and this is where we are going to learn a bit more specifics

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
about how it works.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We have AWS regions, we have availability zones,

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
data centers, edge locations, and points of presence.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And all of these can be represented on the map right here.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's go on this website to have a quick look at it.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is a cool map,

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
because on this website we can see how AWS is global.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If I click on it, I can scroll the world

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and see what is happening.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We can see that AWS has multiple regions,

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and they're in orange and they're all around the world.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
For example, Paris, in Spain, in Ohio, in Sao Paulo,

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Cape Town, Mumbai, and everywhere else.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
AWS truly is a global service.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
On top of it, each region are going to be connected

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
through the network.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
These are the network reconnecting the regions,

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and this is a private network of AWS.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And then within each region, for example,

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
if I really scroll into the Cape Town region,

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
we can see that we have blue dots,

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and each blue dots will be availability zones

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that will be describing in the next slide.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
As we can see, what I want to get you out of this

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
is that AWS truly is global,

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and we can leverage the infrastructure of a cloud provider

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
to make ourselves, or application global.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The first important concept in AWS are regions.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Regions are all around the world, and we saw it on the map

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
from before the regions have a name.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It could be US-east-1, EU-West-3,

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and we can see the mapping of the name of the region

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
to their code on the console that we'll see in a minute.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now, a region, what is in its truly...

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, it's going to be a cluster of data centers.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Many different data centers look at it in near,

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
for example, Ohio, or Singapore, or Sydney, or Tokyo.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When we use AWS services,

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
most services are going to be linked in scope

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to a specific region.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That means that if we use a service in one region

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and we try to use it in another region,

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
it will be like a new time of using the service.

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now, a question that may come up in the exam

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
is how do you choose an AWS region?

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Say you're launching a new application,

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
where should you do it?

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Should you do it in America, in Europe,

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
in South America, or in Australia?

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, the answer is of course, it depends.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But let's look at some factors that may impact your choice

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
of an AWS region.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The first one is compliance.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sometimes governments want the data to be local

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
to the country you're deploying the application in.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
For example, France,

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
data in France may have to stay in France,

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and therefore you should launch your application

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
in the French region.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Then there is also a concept of latency.

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If most of your users are going to be in America,

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it makes a lot of sense to deploy your application

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
in America close to your users,

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
because they will have a reduced latency.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you deploy your application in Australia,

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and your users are in America,

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
they will have a lot of lag using your application.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Then also, not all regions have all services, okay?

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Some regions do not have services,

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and so obviously if you're leveraging a service

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
with your application, you need to make sure

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that the region you're deploying into is available,

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and does have that service.

125
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And finally, pricing.

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Pricing does vary from region to region,

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and you need to consult the appli...

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The services pricing pages to see

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
what the differences are between the regions.

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But this could be obviously a factor

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
that could impact your deployment

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
of an application into a specific region.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now, availability zones are

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
what actually are going into the region.

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Each region will have many availability zones,

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
usually three, the minimum is three, and the max is six,

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
but really the usual is three.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So let's take the Sydney region as an example.

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The Sydney region code is ap-southeast-2.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We have two have three availability zones in Sydney,

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
ap-southeast-2A, ap-southeast-2B,

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and ap-southeast-2C.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Now, each of these availability zones are going to be one

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
or more discrete data centers

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
that will have redundant power networking and connectivity.

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That means that in southeast-2A,

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can have two data centers maybe as well,

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
2 and 2B, and 2 and 2C.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But it could be one, it could be three, it could be four.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We don't really know, it always doesn't tell us that.

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But what we know is that these availability zones

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
are separate from each other

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
so that they will be isolated from disasters.

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If something happens to ap-southeast-2A,

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
we know that it is designed not to cascade

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
into ap-southeast-2B, or ap-southeast-2C.

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They're really isolated from disasters.

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And then these data centers, these availability zones,

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
they are connected with high bandwidth,

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
ultra-low latency networking, and therefore,

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
altogether being linked together,

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
it will form a region.

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, next, the only thing we need to know about AWS

164
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
for the global infrastructure

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
is the points of presence or edge locations.

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We will see them in details in the global section

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
of this course, but you should know

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
that AWS has more than 400 points of presence in 90 cities,

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
across 40 countries.

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And this will be very helpful when we deliver content

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to the end users with the lowest latency possible.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And this is what you see on this map.

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Now, again, I'm going quickly over this

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
because we'll see this at the...

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
About the middle of this course.

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Now how about we just play around

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and do a tour of the consult?

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We'll see that AWS has global services such as IAM,

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Route 53, CloudFront and WAF,

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
but we'll see that also, most AWS services

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
are going to be region scoped, such as Amazon EC2,

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, and Rekognition.

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Finally, to know if a service is available in your region,

184
