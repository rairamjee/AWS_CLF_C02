1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Now, one last touch before get started

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
with this course.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I will be referring to

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the Shared Responsibility Model quite a lot.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And you will see this diagram at the end of this course.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is what define what is your responsibility

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
versus AWS when using the cloud

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and there is a shared responsibility.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You as a customer, you're responsible

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
for the security in the cloud.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So whatever you use in the cloud,

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
however you configure it is your entire responsibility.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That includes security, your data, your operating system,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
your network and firewall configuration, et cetera.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And AWS is going to be responsible

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for the security of the cloud.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So all the infrastructure, all the hardware,

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
all the software, all their own internal security,

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
they are responsible of.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And this is why we have shared responsibility.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam,

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you will be asked some questions around finding

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
what is your responsibility

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and what is the responsibility of AWS.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So I just wanted to give you a quick overview of this

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and in some sections I will be referring back

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to this diagram and this model to tell you

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
what is your responsibility

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and what is the responsibility of AWS.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Finally, when you use AWS,

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you are agreeing to their Acceptable Use Policy,

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
which you can find right here

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and I think it's pretty obvious

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that you cannot do any illegal,

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
harmful of offensive use or content,

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you cannot do any security violation,

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
you cannot abuse a network

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and you cannot do email or other types of messages abuse.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
All of that makes sense but it's good to specify it.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now , I hope you're excited.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're gonna get started with this course

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and actually get to use the cloud.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, I will see you in the next section.
