00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome to the first section of this course

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
in which I will introduce you the Cloud

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and the Cloud Computing.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So this section is not going to be hands-on,

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
it's just some theory and some slight,

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but hopefully it will put some context into

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
why the Cloud is useful and how it works.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So let's go back to the very basics.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How do websites work?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well we have a server hosted somewhere,

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we, as a web browser,

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
want to get access to that server to visualize a websites.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What we are going to do as a client is use a network.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A network between ourselves and the server,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and the client will find the network and will use network

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to route the packets, the data into the server,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then the server will reply to us,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and we will get the response, and we can view a website.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Obviously that is very simplified,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but that gives you an idea.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now for the clients to find the server

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and the server to find the clients,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
you need to have IP addresses.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So a clients have IP addresses

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and a server also have an IP address.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And so the idea is that when you use an IP address,

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
you can send a request to wherever you want

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to the server you want,

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and the server can know how to find you back.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is very similar to when you are

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
writing some letters to your friend.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
For example, you would write a letter,

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and that would be your data, and you would be the client,

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
then when you send the letter you put it in your mailbox,

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and then the network will be the network of the post office,

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
then the post office will use network

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and the address you put on the letter

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
to route your letter to the destination,

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which is, in this case, the server,

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and then if your correspondent wants to reply you back,

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
they can use the address you put on the back of the envelope

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
to write you back, and again,

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
use the same network to get the letter back to you.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So servers are just like the network of your mail.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hopefully that's a good analogy.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So what is in a server?

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well a server is going to contain a CPU,

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and a CPU is a little piece

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
that will be doing some computations,

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
it will be very helpful

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to do some calculations and find results,

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and then, your server also needs RAM, or memory.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is going to be very, very fast memory,

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
which will allow us to store information

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and retrieve it very quickly.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So when we have a CPU and a memory bar, what do we get?

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well we get a brain.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Think of your brain.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
When you are thinking, you are actually making computations,

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
very complicated ones, but they are computations,

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
but then you need to retain some information,

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and again, we have memories

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and these memories are in our brain,

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
so if we think of the CPU and the RAM together,

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
they sort of look like a brain.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now we also need to have

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
some more long-term storage of data.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Obviously it's still in our brain as humans,

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
but in computers, we have included

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
some special storage to store data, for example, files,

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and then if we want to store the data

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
in a more structured way, we're going to use a database,

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and a database is going to be data formatted in a way

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that we can easily search it and query it.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Finally in the server,

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
we're also going to have some networking aspect.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So there's going to be the routers, switch, DNS servers,

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and don't worry, all these terms,

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
we'll be seeing them later on in this course.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So in the server, we an aspect of compute, memory, storage,

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
maybe your server sometimes is a database,

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and we have a networking aspect.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All these things are gonna super important going forward

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
because the cloud is going to be giving these things

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
for us on demand.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So if we just want to define

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
a little bit of IT terminology before we get started,

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the network is a bunch of cables, routers, and servers

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
that are going to be connected with each other,

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and the router is a specific device

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
that will forward the data packets

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
between computer in the networks, and they will know

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
where to send your packets on the internet,

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
just like your post delivery service.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now when we have a packet and it arrives as a destination,

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
there's a switch, and the switch

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
will send the packet to the correct clients on your network.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So if we put all these things together, it looks like this.

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Our client will send the data to a router,

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
the router will find it's way all the way to a switch,

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and the switch will know to which computer

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
in your network to send the data to.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So why do I introduce all these things?

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, let's go back to traditional IT.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
When people used to start websites or companies before,

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
they used to do it in their home or their garage,

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and so they would literally go to the store,

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
buy a server, and they put the server in their home.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You may have seen TV shows,

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you may have read some documentation on the internet

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
that describes on how Google was made.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know, Google was started in a garage.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now, as your website grows, you need to add

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
more and more servers to serve that demand,

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and so your home starts to be filled with servers.

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So this bad right, but your company is getting bigger,

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
you're generating some money,

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
so you're going to move to your own office,

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and you decide to allocate a special room

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
which is going to be called a data center.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In a data center, you're going to have, again, your servers,

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and you're going to be able to scale them

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
by adding and purchasing more and more servers.

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now this worked, and this worked for so many years,

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
but there are a few problems with this approach.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Number one is that when you have a data center

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
or your own home, you're going to have to pay your rent,

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
then you're going to have to add power supply,

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
cooling, and maintenance

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
because it does require some electricity

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to run your servers, it does require some cooling

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
because the servers do get hot,

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and sometimes they break down,

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
so you need someone to do the maintenance.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
On top of it, if you want to add or replace servers,

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
it will take a lot of time because you have to order them,

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and then you have to hook them up in your center.

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Scaling is limited.

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If tomorrow you're getting 10 times bigger,

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
you're going to need 10 times more servers,

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
but you may not have the time or the space to do so.

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You also need to hire a team

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that is going to be there all the time,

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
24/7 to monitor the infrastructure

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
in case something goes wrong.

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And what if there is a disaster,

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
what if there is an earthquake,

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
what if there's a power shutdown, or even a fire?

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That would be bad, right?

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So can we externalize all this?

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And the answer is yes, and that will be the cloud.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So I will see you in the next lecture

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to discuss a little bit more about the cloud.
