1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Let's do a summary

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
on what we learned for EC2.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So we have created EC2 instances,

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and they were composed of an AMI,

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which was defining the operating system.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Then we defined an instance size where we defined

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
how much CPU power we want and how much RAM we want.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We described the storage for our EC2 instance.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We defined the firewall on our EC2 instance

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
with the security groups.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And finally, a bootstrap script called the EC2 User Data

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that was started when the EC2 instance was started.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So the security groups are attached to EC2 instances,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and they are a firewall outside of your instance.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And you can define rules to allow which ports

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and which IP can access your EC2 instance.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For EC2 user data, this was a script that we launched

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
at the first start of an instance that we used to set up

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
our EC2 instance to be a web server and say, "Hello, world."

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
SSH was our way for us to start a terminal

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
from our computers into our EC2 instances

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to start issuing commands on port 22.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And once we did it, we were able to leverage

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
an EC2 instance role that was similar to an IAM role

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
to have our EC2 instance issue commands against IAM.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In terms of purchasing options,

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
you have multiple options you need to know for the exam.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You have on-demand, spot instances,

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
reserved instances for standard or convertible,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
dedicated host, dedicated instance, and that's it.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So that's it for this lecture.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
