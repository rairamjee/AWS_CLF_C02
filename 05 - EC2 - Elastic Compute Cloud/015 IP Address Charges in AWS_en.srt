1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So I wanna talk about IPv4 charges in AWS.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So since February 1st, 2024, there is now a charge

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
for all Public IPv4 created in your account

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
whether or not they are being used.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And so you have a $0.005 per hour

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
of Public IPv4, which is about 3.6 dollars per month

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
whenever you have a Public IPv4 in your account.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So you have a Public IPv4 for example,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
when you create an EC2 instance.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now for the EC2 service,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for new accounts in AWS you have a free tier of 12 month,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and in the first 12 months of your account,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
you will have 750 hours of Public IPv4 per month.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That means that when you go over,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
you're going to pay, of course,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and for any other service than EC2,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
there is no free tier, and you're going to pay that charge.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So it's a bit annoying.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So let me just try to do a diagram to explain to you.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So when we create an EC2 instance, we try to connect to it,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and so we'll have a public IP.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And so this is free until 750 hours per month of usage,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
which is about a month.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you create a second EC2 instance

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and you also create a public IP for that EC2 instance,

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
then again this goes towards the 750 hours per month.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So you can have three, four EC2 instances,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
it doesn't matter, as long as together,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the public IP usage is less than 750 hours per month,

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you're good to go.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But if you go over, and you have four Public IPv4

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
for example, at the same time,

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
then of course you're going to pay for all of them

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
after this free tier.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
When we go later on and create load balancers, for example,

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
then you may have one Public IPv4 per AZ.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So if you launch a load balancer in three AZ,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
you'll have three Public IPv4.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Here, there is no free tier,

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and so you will have charges incurred

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
while using a load balancer.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So it's a good idea to, if you wanna create it,

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
know that you'll have charges,

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and know that you won't delete it fast enough

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
after doing the hands-on.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
For an Amazon RDS Database for example, again,

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
this is not the EC2 service.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So when you create a database

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and you want to connect to it from your public computer,

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you will create a public IPv4 address,

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and there is no free tier,

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
so you will have charges around it.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So just be mindful that you will have charges

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
in this course.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I said you would not,

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but this is unfortunately a big change,

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and there's no way around it.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So if you want to use any other service than EC2

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and connect to it publicly,

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you will have IPv4 addresses,

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and you will have charges for it.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So please make sure

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to never leave things running for too long.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now you may ask me, "What about IPv6?"

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So yes, the whole idea behind these charges for AWS is

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that they're trying to migrate everything to IPv6,

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
where it's a bit easier to have them at scale.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And so in this course, I would love to use IPv6,

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
but it turns out that many internet service providers

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
around the world do not support IPv6 yet.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And so this course will not work for some of you.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So usually, you can go to an address like this,

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
for example, test-ipv6.com

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
to see if IPv6 is working for you.

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But unfortunately, because, I mean, I am fortunate

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to have so many millions of students around the world,

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but it won't work for all of you,

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
then I'm not going to change the course for that reason.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So if you use IPv6 in this course on your own

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
because you want to avoid this tiny charge,

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
then you're on your own.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But know that you'll have to create

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
your own security group rules.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You make sure you make your own networking decisions,

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but it's possible.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And if you know about networking, you will figure this out.

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But if you're new to cloud computing, AWS, IT,

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
or networking in general, then keep on going with IPv4

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and be mindful that you will have charges for IPv4.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now, if you have charges, you may want to troubleshoot them,

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
so you need to go to your bill to see your charges.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And then there's a service

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
called the AWS Public Insights service that can help you.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And there's also a nice article that I've linked right here

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
that is explaining how you can troubleshoot these charges

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
if you can't figure out

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
which service still has an IPv4 address in use

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and how you're being charged.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So just remember that if you have any cost,

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
you go under billing and cost management in your account,

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and then you go under bills on the left hand side,

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and you will have a bill summary.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And here you can see your charges by service

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and understand what is costing you any kind of money

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
by just drilling down.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So here on the right hand side, you would have an amount,

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and then you can expand everything

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and see what the amount equates to.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So if you have IPv4 charges,

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
they will appear right here,

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and it's important for you to understand them.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Also, if you want to see your IP addresses,

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
you type IPAM, I-P-A-M in here,

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and you go to Amazon VPC IP Address Manager,

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
which is a feature in the VPC console.

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And this is how you can monitor all your IP addresses

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
in your account and get some information.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So you can go clear and click on Public IP Insights.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And here, you need to create an IPAM,

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and we're saying yes to everything.

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We can use it in the free tier

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
just to get the Public IPv4 usage in your organization.

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And then you would go ahead, select the regions you wanted.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So, you can add all the regions,

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and then click on Create IPAM.

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And this will give you some insights

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
into your public IPs being used.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is within the free tier.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Again, we're here under the free tier.

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And so under Public IP Insights,

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
you would get some information around your public IPs

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
once information has been gathered on it.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So that's it for this lecture.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I hope you liked it.

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
