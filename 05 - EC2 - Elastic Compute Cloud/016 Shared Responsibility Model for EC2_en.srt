1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Now again,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
one more reminder into the Shared Responsibility Model

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and how this applies for EC2.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So AWS is going to be responsible for all data centers,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
their infrastructure and the security of them,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
then AWS is going to be responsible

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
for making sure you have isolation on the physical host,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
if you're getting,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
for example, a dedicated host or replacing faulty hardware

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if one of their servers is failing,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or making sure they are still compliant with the regulations

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that they have agreed to.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But you as a user,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
you're responsible for the security in the cloud.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So that means that you define your own security group rules.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And this allows you or other people to access

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
or not your EC2 instances.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You own the entire virtual machine

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
inside of your EC2 instance.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So that means that your operating system will be Windows

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
or Linux, all the patches and the updates.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You have to do them not AWS.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
AWS will give you the virtual machine.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's up to you to handle it the way you want.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That means that all the software

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and the utilities that are installed on this EC2 instance,

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
also are yours to be responsible for.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Finally, understanding how to assign AM Roles

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and make sure the permissions are correct.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And finally, making sure data is secure on your instance

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
is also very important for your EC2 instances.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So that's it.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hope that again puts a bit of perspective

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
on to the shared responsibility model for EC2

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
