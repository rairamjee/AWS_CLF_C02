1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All right.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now we're going to add SSH into our EC2 Instance

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
using our Linux or our Mac computer.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And you may say, what the hell is SSH?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What are you talking about Stephane?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, SSH is one of the most important function

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
when you deal with Amazon Cloud.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It basically allows you

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to control a remote machine or server,

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
all using your terminal or your command line.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So how does that look like with the diagram?

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, we have our EC2 machine,

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and we launched Amazon Linux 2 on it

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and our machine has a public IP.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now we want to access that machine.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And so for this, I don't know if you remember

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but we have a security group

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and on it we allowed the Port 22 of SSH.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So what's going to happen is at our computer,

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
so my laptop for you, for me, or whatever for you,

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
then we'll access over the web.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Through that Port 22,

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it will access the EC2 machine.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Basically, our command line interface is going to be

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
just as if we were inside that machine.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So let's get started.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So we are going to SSH into our instance.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So remember that PEM file you've downloaded

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
called EC2 Tutorial.pem?

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Please make sure to remove the space in it

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
if you have a space, even if you have a PPK file.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Please rename it and remove the space from it.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So EC2Tutorial.pem is removed for me.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And then, you go ahead and place it in a directory you like.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So for me, I took my file and I pasted it,

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and I placed it in a folder called aws-course. Okay?

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So this is the first step to making sure you are ready.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So next, what I'm going to do is that I am going to go

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
in my EC2 instance overview page

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and find my first instance.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So here we have my first instance

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and we're going to SSH into it.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So we're going to open a remote terminal into it.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And for this, I need to get the public IPv4 address,

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
so I can copy this, and I will use it later.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The other thing I need to do

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
is to look at the security of my instance.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So again, if you did everything with me,

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
then your security groups have this rule in it

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
called Port 22 which is the SSH port

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
from anywhere by 0.0.0.0/0. Okay?

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So if you have that rule, then you're good to go.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If not, please click on the security group

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and add the missing rule.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Next, I need to try to do an SSH.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So first of all, ssh ec2-user@

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and then the IP you have.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So the reason we do ssh ec2-user

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
is because the Amazon Linux 2 AMI

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
has one user already set up for us

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and that user is named ec2-user.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Then we have at,

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to say that we want to access that user

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
on the specific server.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And then, we have the IP right here.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is the public IP of our EC2 instance.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So we try this.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So we do SSH and then we're going to get

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
a too many authentication failure.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So that means that we don't authenticate

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
into our EC2 instances.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, that makes sense

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
because we haven't specified the key

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that we downloaded from before yet. Okay?

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You may get another kind of error

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but right now this is the one I get.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So for this,

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
we need to reference the file we just downloaded

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
called EC2Tutorial.pem into our command.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So make sure again, there is no space.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And then, you need to make sure your terminal

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
is exactly where your file is.

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So if I do ls right here to list the files in my folder

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and I'm sorry if this is too advanced for you

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
but I have to cover the grounds for everyone.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So if I do ls, as you see right now,

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
it says EC2Tutorial.pem

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that's because I placed my command line

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
in the correct directory on my computer.

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay.

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So for this, if you were not in the correct directory,

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
for example if I was line level up, so I do cd ..,

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
which puts me one level up,

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
then I do ls.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Of course, I don't see my EC2Tutorial.pem.

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay?

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So to do so, what you can do is just check where you are.

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So pwd is where you are.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So, I'm in user stephanemaarek

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and I know that I placed my folder aws-course

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
within my home.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So right under user stephanemareek, there is aws-course.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So for this, then I know that I can do ls or ll

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
just to confirm that my folder exists.

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
As you can see right here is my aws-course folder,

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
so this is good.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So what I do is I will do cd and then aws-course

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
which now puts me in the directory of my aws-course.

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So if I do pwd, I am in the correct directory.

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And if I do ls, I can see my EC2Tutorial.pem file.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The reason we have to do this is that

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
because now in the next command.

114
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So the SSH command,

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
you do ssh -i then you specify the EC2Tutorial.pem file

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and that will not work

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
if you're not in the correct directory.

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So please make sure to get there

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and if you're missing the bit of the Linux here,

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
please try to go online,

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but I should be good with what I showed you.

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And then, ec2-user@

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and we reference the public IP of our instance.

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So this one right here, we reference it.

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Press enter,

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and now we get another kind of error

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
which is saying that we have an unprotected key file

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and we need to change the permissions for it.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So for that reason, we'll have to enter another command

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and that command is chmod.

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So chmod 0400, and then we pass in the file itself

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
so EC2Tutorial.pem.

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So I clear my screen

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and then I'm going to try the exact same command as before.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So I press enter and I am logged into my machine.

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So you may have seen a screen

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
where they prompt you for yes/no

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to trust the instance as well,

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
just enter yes if you do get that screen.

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So as you can see,

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
now I have done the SSH into my instance

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and now it says ec2-use at this IP,

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
which means that now all the commands are issued

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
are going to be issued directly

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
from the Amazon Linux 2 AMI EC2 instance

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
that I've just launched from before.

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So let's try a few commands.

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
For example, if you do whoami

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
then it says ec2-user

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
or I can ping google.com

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and we see the google.com is responding to our pings.

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So we can launch some commands directly

153
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
from the Amazon Linux 2 AMI,

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and I did control C to stop that command,

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now to exit the instance itself, you can either type exit

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and I think this should work,

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
or you do control G and then you will close the connection

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
into the EC2 instance.

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And if you ever want to get back into it

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
remember this command,

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
ssh -I EC2Tutorial.pem

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
if you are in the correct directory.

163
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Please make sure to do so.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
As well as ec2-user@

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and then the public IP of your instance.

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Remember that if you stop and then start your instance

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
then the public IP can change.

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So make sure to change that part as well.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
All right.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So that's it for this lecture.

171
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
