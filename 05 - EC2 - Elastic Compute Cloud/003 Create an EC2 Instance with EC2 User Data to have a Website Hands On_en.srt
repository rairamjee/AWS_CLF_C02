1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Welcome.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So in this lecture we are going

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
to launch our first EC2 instance running Amazon Linux.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So for this we'll be launching our first EC2 instance,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is well a visual server

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we'll use the console for this.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We'll get a high level approach

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to all the various parameters you have

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
when launching an EC2 instance,

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and you'll see there are many,

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but we'll learn the most important ones.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And then we will launch a web server directly

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
on the EC2 instance using a piece of code we will pass

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to the EC2 instance that is called the user data.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Finally, we'll learn how to start, stop

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and terminate our instance.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So let's get started and launch our first EC2 instance.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
For this, I'm gonna go

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
into the EC2 Console, then I will click on Instances

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and then click on Launch Instances.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So in there I'm able to launch my first EC2 instance

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and to do so I need to add a name and tags.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So the name is going to be My First Instance

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and that is an app that is the name tag.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And if you wanted to add additional tags

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to tag your instance differently,

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
then you could click there, but you don't need

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to click on this using just name

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
as My First Instance is good enough.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Next, you need to choose a base image for your EC2 instance.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is the operating system of your instance.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
As you can see, there's a full catalog that you can search

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
from, but we're going to use the ones

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
from the quick start that are very, very helpful.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And the one we'll be using is the Amazon Linux,

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
which is provided by AWS.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So in it I will choose the Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And as you can see that one is free tier eligible.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So we'll just leave it as is.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So this gives me Amazon Linux 2

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and the architecture I will choose is 64-bits x86.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So everything left pretty much as a default

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and we'll see in this section and more

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and the other ones, you can create your own AMIs

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and you can found them in here, okay?

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But currently we're just going to use the ones provided

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
by AWS as quick starts.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Next, we need to choose an instance type.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And so instance types are going to differ based

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
on the number of CPUs they have, the amount

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
of memory they have and how much they cost.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
As you can see right now I have a t2.micro selected.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This one is free tier eligible, so it will be free

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
to launch one of them during an entire month

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
if we leave it running.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So this is what we'll be using.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But in here you could scroll down

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and look at other types of instances.

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
For example, t1.micro is also free tier eligible,

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
but that's older generation.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And as you can see, you have a bunch

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
of instances right here available to you.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Some of them are going

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
to be free tier eligible, some of them will not.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And by default, the one

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
that's gonna be free tier eligible is a t2.micro.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So we'll be using that one a lot.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you wanted

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
to compare the instance types, you would just click on

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
that link and it shows you all the type of instances in here

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
as well as how much memory they have and so on.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So right now we'll be using a t2.micro.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay next, a key pair to log into your instance.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So this is necessary if we use the SSH utility

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
to access our instance and we will be using the SSH utility

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
in this course.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Therefore, it is required for us to create a key pair.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So as we can see right now there is no key pair

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and we could proceed without a key pair,

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
but for now we won't do this.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So let's go ahead and create a new key pair

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and the name is going to be EC2 Tutorial.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Then you need to choose a key pair type.

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So we'll be using the RSA encrypted, okay, this is good.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And then the key pair format.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So if you have Mac or Linux

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
or Windows 10, then you can use the .pem format.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If you have Windows less than version 10,

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
for example Windows 7

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
or Windows 8, then you can do our shortcut

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and directly use a ppk, which is going to be used for PuTTY

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and PuTTY is how you do SSH on windows 7

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and Windows 8.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So remember anything else but Windows 7

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and Windows 8, choose .ppm else use ppk.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay, I should be clear enough, I'm going

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to create this key pair and it is downloaded

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
for me directly.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So now it is selected automatically here.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Next we have to go into network settings.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So for now, I will not touch anything.

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
My instance is going to get a public IP

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and then we need to connect to our instance.

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And so for this, there's going

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to be a security group attached

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to our instance, which is going to control the traffic from

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and to our instance, and therefore we can add rules.

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And the first security group created will be called

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
launch-wizard-1.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So created by the console directly

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and we can define multiple rules.

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So the first rule we want to have is

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to allow SSH traffic from anywhere.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So we leave it as this and this will create a rule

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
in our security group to allow SSH traffic,

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
but we also want to allow HTTP traffic from the internet.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So we'll tick that box and this is

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
because we're going to launch a web server

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
on our EC2 instance, so we need it as well.

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
As we're now going to use HTTPS

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
for now, we don't need to tick the second box.

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's configure the storage

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
so then we can configure the storage.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And as we can see we have eight gigabits gp2 root volume

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that will leave it as is, okay?

126
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Because in the free tier we can get up to 30 gigabytes

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
of EBS general purpose SSD storage.

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So this is good. And we only have one volume necessary.

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If you go into advanced, you could configure them

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and see a little bit more information, okay?

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And the one important thing

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to note in here is the delete on termination.

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
By default, it is unable to yes, I just did advanced

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to show you that one detail, okay?

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That means that once we terminate our EC2 instance, then

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
that volume is also going to be deleted.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay, so we leave everything as is

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and we'll be get back into the simple mode.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay?

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Next, for advanced details,

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
this is where it gets interesting.

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So I will skip spot, I will skip IAM instance profile.

143
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't worry, I will go

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
over them once we need to explore them.

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I will skip all of that. So let's scroll down.

146
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's scroll down, let's scroll down all the way

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to the bottom.

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And at the bottom there is user data.

149
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
User data is when we pass a script.

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So some comments to our EC2 instance

151
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
to execute on the first launch of our EC2 instance

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and only the first launch.

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And therefore on the first launch, we want

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
to be able to pass these command right here.

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So for this, you go into your code, you go

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to the EC2 fundamentals,

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and then the EC2 user data set file, you copy entirely this,

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
so all of it.

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And then you paste it here. So you paste everything.

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And that means that this script is going

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to be executed when the instance is first started

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and only once, okay?

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
In the whole lifecycle of the instance.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And what it's going to do is that it's going

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
to update a few things, then install the HTTPD web server

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
on the machine and then write a file, an HTML file.

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That will be our web server.

168
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And so you don't need to know code or know these commands.

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay?

170
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is provided to you to illustrate a few things

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
on this lecture.

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So finally for summary, we want to start one instance.

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is great and we can review everything we have here.

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It all looks good. We are very happy.

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And as you can see in the free tier, we get a first year

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
of 750 hours of 2.micro, which is running it for one month.

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So that's every month.

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And if you don't have a t.2micro

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
in your region, then it's going to be a t3.micro, okay?

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And then also we get 30 gigabytes of EBS storage and so on.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So let's launch this instance and the instance is going

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
to be launched.

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's go to View all Instances, Refresh.

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And now my instance is in pending state.

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So it's gonna take about 10, 15 seconds

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
for the instance to come up.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And this is the whole power of the cloud.

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Thanks to the cloud, I am able to create an instance or 100

189
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
of them very quickly in less than 10 seconds

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
without me owning any single server.

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So that is extremely powerful

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and we just scratched the surface of the power of the cloud,

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
obviously because the course is just getting started,

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
but you can get a feeling of the advances

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and the speed we can have on the cloud thanks to this.

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So as you can see now my instance is running

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and right now I wanna show you a few things, okay?

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The first one is

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that the instance name is My First Instance,

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and there's an instance ID which is just

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
a unique identifier for my instance.

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There is a public IPv4 address.

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This is what we're going to use to access our EC2 instance.

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Or there is a private IPv4 address, which is how

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
to access that instance internally

206
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
on the AWS network, which is private.

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The instance site is running and we get some information

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
around host name, private DNS, which instance that we have.

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So t2.micro as well as if you scroll

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
down the AMI we're using, which is Amazon Linux 2,

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and the key pair we're using, which is EC2 tutorial, okay?

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So you can have a look at a few details in here.

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You have more information.

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
For example, on security, we get some information

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
on the security group, which was created called

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
launch-wizard-1 with these inbound rules.

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So port 22 accessible from everywhere

218
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and port 80 accessible from everywhere.

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So you should have something similar, okay?

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If you don't start over because you probably missed a step.

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And the rule allowing all communication

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
outwards, which allows the instance to access the internet.

223
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
For storage we saw that, yes, we created one volume

224
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
of eight gigabytes, so we're good to go.

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So now let's have a look

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
at the web server running on my instance.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And for this you go on public IPv4 address, you copy this

228
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
or you click on Open Address.

229
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And as you can see, it doesn't work.

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Or if you click on it, copy

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and then paste it, you press Enter, it's going to work.

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So it depends on the web browsers you have and so on. Okay?

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But the reason it doesn't work here is that

234
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
in the URL you need to make sure

235
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
that you're using the HTTP protocol,

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
so http:// and then the IP.

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Because if you use HTTPS, this is not going to work.

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's going to give you an infinite loading screen

239
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
which was happening right here.

240
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So please make sure to use http:// and then the IP address.

241
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And you're going to get this screen.

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And in programming, when you do something

243
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
for the first time, you usually say Hello World.

244
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So this web server is saying,

245
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hello World from and this IP right here,

246
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
which is not the public IP, this IP right here,

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
172-31-33-135 actually corresponds

248
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
to the private IPv4 address.

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So this is something that I program myself.

250
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So we use the public IP address to access it,

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
but we have the private IP address in here

252
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and we have the hello world.

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And if you go too fast, you're going to get no messages.

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So if you go too fast, just wait five minutes, get back

255
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
to it, refresh this page and you'll see it.

256
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay, so cool, we have a web server running, this is great.

257
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Now let's explore a few options.

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So we have an EC2 instance and it's running,

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but if we don't need it, we can go to instance states

260
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and then click on Stop Instance.

261
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And in the cloud you can start

262
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and stop instances just as you wish.

263
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And why would you stop an instance?

264
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, the longer you leave it running, the more you're going

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
to pay of course.

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But if you decide

267
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
to stop an instance, then AWS will not bill you for it.

268
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The instance state is kept

269
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
because you have a volume attached to it,

270
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but at least you're not paying for it.

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So we can see right now, well the instance is

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
in a stopping state, and if we try

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
to refresh this page, it's going to,

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
of course it's not going to work

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
because well you don't have the server running anymore.

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So you can see it gets

277
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
to some like infinite loading experience.

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay?

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So my instance is now stopped and if I wanted

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
to actually I could get rid of it.

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And in the cloud it's very common

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
to start instances and then get rid of them.

283
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We're very quickly just to try it out

284
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
because this is the cloud and we can do whatever we want.

285
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So we can do in instance state and then terminate instance.

286
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If we do so, we're going to get a warning message

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and don't click on Terminate

288
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
because I want to keep this instance with me, okay?

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But this is how we would get rid of it.

290
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So I cancel this, but what I'm going to do now is I'm going

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
to start my instance again.

292
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So I go to Instance State and then Start Instance.

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And now as you can see, the state is pending,

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
so it is getting started and I just wait for it

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to be started in the green state

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and I will show you something very interesting.

297
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, so my instance is now running, and if I go here

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and stop the refresh and try again to refresh,

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
as you can see, it still goes into an infinite loop.

300
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, you may say while the server is running, Stefan.

301
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So why is it not displaying the message now?

302
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It is displaying here,

303
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
but like from the old one, of course.

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So here the IP start with 54, right?

305
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But here, if you click on here, now the public IP start

306
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
with 3.250.

307
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So the public IP actually has changed.

308
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So if you stop an instance and then you start it later

309
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
on, then AWS will maybe change its public IPv4.

310
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So therefore you need

311
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to copy the new IPv4, make sure to use HTP.

312
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And voila, we have access back to our EC2 instance.

313
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But one thing that has not changed is the private IPv4,

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
the private IP will always stay the same,

315
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
but the public IPv4 may change.

316
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay? So well, so that's it for this hands-on.

317
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We have seen quite a lot of things.

318
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We've launched our first EC2 instance,

319
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
which is very exciting.

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Our first web server in the cloud.

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We've had to look at some of the power of the cloud.

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're just using some API calls

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
to stop an instance, start instance, and so on.

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So I hope you liked it and I will see you

325
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
in the next lecture.
