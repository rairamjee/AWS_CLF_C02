00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi, and welcome to this lecture

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
on EC2 Instances Purchasing Options.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So we've been using so far, on-demand EC2 instances.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They allow us to run instances on demands,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that means they're good for short workloads,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we get predictable pricing,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we're going to pay by the second.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But if you have different kind of workloads,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
you can optimize your discounts and your pricing

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
by specifying it to AWS.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For example, you can use reserved instances

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and you have one year or three years term,

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and they're meant for long workloads.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So if you know you're going to run a database

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
for a long time, then a reserved instance is great.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And if you want to have a flexible instance type,

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so for example, you want to change

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the instance type over time,

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
then convertible reserved instances are for you.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And by the way, don't worry,

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to do a deep dive in all of those over time.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, next we have savings plan

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and savings plan are one and three years term,

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and they're more modern

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
because instead of committing to a specific instance type,

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
you commit to a specific amount of usage in dollars,

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and there again, for long workloads.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Spot instances instead are meant

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
for very short workloads,

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
they're very, very cheap,

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but at any time you can lose these instances

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and that makes them less reliable.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Dedicated host allows you to book an entire physical server

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and control instance placements.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And dedicated instances means that

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
no other customers will share your hardware.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Finally, capacity reservations allow you to reserve capacity

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
in a specific AZ for any duration.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now let's look at EC2 on-demand.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So you're going to pay for what you use.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So that means that if you're using Linux or Windows,

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
you're going to be getting a billing per second

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
after the first minute,

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
or for all the other operating systems,

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you're going to get a billing per hour.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It has the highest cost but no upfront payments

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and no long-term commitments.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That means it's definitely recommended for a short-term

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and uninterrupted workload

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
where you cannot predict how the application will behave.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now for reserved instances,

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and by the way, the numbers I show you can change over time,

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
so I will not update this video every time,

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but it gives you an idea of what the numbers can be.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So the reserved instances give you a 72% discounts

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
compared to on-demand.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And you reserve a specific instance attributes.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
For example, the instance type, the region,

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
the tenancy, and the OS.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You specify a reservation period one year or three years,

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
to get even more discounts,

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and whether or not you wanna pay upfront,

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
partially upfront, or not upfront.

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And all upfront of course gives you

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
the maximum amount of discounts.

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In terms of the scope,

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
do you want the scope to be

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
into a specific region or a zone?

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That means reserve capacity in a specific AZ.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And so you would use reserved instances

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
for the steady-state usage applications,

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
think for example, for a database.

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And you can buy or sell your reserved instances

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
in a marketplace if you don't need them anymore.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And there is a specific kind of reserved instances

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
called the convertible reserved instance,

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
which is allowing you to change the instance type,

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the instance family, the operating system,

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the scope and the tenancy.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And because you have more flexibility,

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
well you get a bit less discounts

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you get up to 66% discounts.

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So that's for reserved instances.

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And now you have the EC2 savings plans

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
which is to allow you to get a discount

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
based on long-term usage,

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
which is the same 70% as reserved instances.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But instead, you're going to say,

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
"I want to spend $10 per hour for the next 1, 2, 3 years."

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And any usage beyond the savings plan

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
is going to be billed at the on-demand price.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So with savings plans,

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
you're locked to a specific instance family and region.

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
For example, you say,

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
"I want to have M5 type of instance family in us-east-1."

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But you're flexible across the instance size.

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So you can have m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge and so on.

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The OS, so you can switch

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
between Linux and Windows and so on.

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And the tenancy, you can switch

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
between host, dedicated and default.

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now, for spot instances,

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
they have the most aggressive discounts,

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
so up to 90% discounts compared to on-demand,

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
but they are instances you can lose at any point of time

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
because you define a max price

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you're willing to pay for your spot instances.

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And if the spot price goes over it,

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
then you're going to lose it.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So they're the most cost-efficient instances in AWS

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and they're going to be very helpful

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
if you have a workload that is resilient to failure.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So what could they be?

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, it could be batch jobs, data analysis,

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
image processing, any kind of distributed workloads,

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
or workloads that have a flexible start and end time.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They are not suited for critical jobs or databases

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and the exam will test you on that.

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Next we have dedicated hosts.

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So you get an actual physical server

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
with EC2 instances capacity

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
fully dedicated to your use case.

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And you want to have dedicated hosts

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
in the use case of, you have compliance requirements

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
or you need to use your existing

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
server-bound software licenses that has billing

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
based on a per-socket, per-core, per VM software licenses.

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is in these kind of use cases

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
that you need to access the physical server

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and get a dedicated host.

131
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So for dedicated hosts, you get on-demand,

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and you're gonna pay per second,

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
or you can reserve them for one or three years.

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They're the most expensive option of AWS

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
because you actually reserve a physical server.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And so again, a use case is when you have

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
a software that comes with a licensing model

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that is bring your own license.

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Or if you have a company that has strong regulatory

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
or compliance needs.

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We also have dedicated instances,

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and there are instances that runs on hardware

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
that's dedicated to you,

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
which is different from the physical server.

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But you may share the hardware with other instances

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
in the same accounts

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and you have no control over instance placements.

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So there's a difference between dedicated instances

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and hosts, that is here.

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
At the exam, honestly, it doesn't trick you

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
into one or the other,

152
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
but remember that dedicated instances

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
mean that you have your own instance on your own hardware,

154
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
whereas dedicated host,

155
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you get access to the physical server itself

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and it gives you visibility into the lower level hardware.

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Next, we have capacity reservations for EC2.

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you can reserve on-demand instances

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
in a specific AZ for any duration.

160
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And then you get access to that capacity

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
whenever you need it.

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You have no time commitment so you can reserve capacity

163
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
or cancel your reservation at any time.

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And no billing discounts.

165
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The only purpose is to reserve capacity.

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So if you want to get billing discounts,

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
you need to combine it with regional reserved instances

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
or your savings plan.

169
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And you're charged at the on-demand rates,

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
whether or not you run instances.

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So that means that your reserved capacity,

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you're going to be billed for it,

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and you know for sure that if you want to launch instances

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
they're going to be available,

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
but if you don't launch them,

176
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
you're still going to get charged.

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So they're very suitable

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
for short-term uninterrupted workloads

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that need to be in a specific AZ.

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So it gets difficult to understand

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
which purchasing option is right for me,

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
especially if you are a beginner.

183
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But let me give you a summary.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The first one is on-demand.

185
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So we'll take a resort as an analogy.

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And with on-demand,

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
you have a resort and you come in whenever you like

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and whenever you like, you pay the full price.

189
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
For reserved, well, you like to plan ahead

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and you know you're going to stay a very long time

191
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in your resort, one, two, three years,

192
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and then you're going to get a good discount

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
because we know you're going to stay long time.

194
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Savings plan is saying,

195
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
"Hey, I know for sure that in my resort

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm going to spend a specific amount.

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So I'm going to spend maybe $300 per month

198
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
every month for the next 12 months."

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And therefore, you may wanna change the room type over time.

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So king, suite, sea view, and so on.

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But the savings plan is saying,

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
"Hey, you're to commit

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to a specific spending in your hotel."

204
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Spot instances are whenever

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
the hotel runs very last-minute discounts

206
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
because they have empty rooms and they wanna attract people.

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So they get empty rooms

208
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and people bid on getting this empty room.

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And so you get very, very discounts.

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But in this specific resort,

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
well, you can get kicked out of at any time

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
if someone is willing to pay more

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
for your room than what you did.

214
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But I don't wanna stay in such a resort.

215
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Dedicated host is saying,

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
"Hey, I want to book the entire building of the resort."

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So you get your own hardware, your own resort.

218
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And then capacity reservation is saying,

219
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
"I'm going to book a room,

220
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm not even sure if I don't stay in,

221
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but I know that if I want to stay in, I will have it."

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And you will pay full price

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
for booking that room nonetheless.

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In terms of price comparison,

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I've just put together this table to give you

226
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
one example at one point of time.

227
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I took an m4.large in us-east-1,

228
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and the on-demand price is 10 cents,

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
but then the spot price is going to be up to,

230
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
for example, 61% off in my example.

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Then if you want to reserve your instance,

232
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
as you can see, you have different pricing.

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If you wanted to have for one year, for three years,

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and pay no upfront or all upfront.

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Same for the EC2 savings plan

236
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
we see that it is the same as a reserved instance discounts.

237
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We also get reserved convertible instances

238
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and we have dedicated host,

239
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
which is at the on-demand price.

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The dedicated host reservation which is up to 70% off

241
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
because you reserve your host.

242
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And capacity reservation again at the on-demand price.

243
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So the exam will ask you to just know

244
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
which type of instance is the right one

245
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
based on your workloads.

246
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And by now, you should have some good hints,

247
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and don't worry, we will practice this over time.

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
All right, that's it for this lecture,

249
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I hope you liked it.

250
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
