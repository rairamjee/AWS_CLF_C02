1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You're getting to one of the trickier bits

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of running in the Cloud, which is how do you connect

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
inside of your servers

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to perform some maintenance or action.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So for this, for Linux servers,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we can use SSH to do a secure shell into our servers.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So based on the operating system you have on your computer,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
you have different ways of achieving it.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So I have separated Mac, Linux,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Windows before version 10 and Windows after version 10.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So the SSH is a command line interface utility

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that can be used on Mac or Linux

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
as well as Windows over version 10.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then if you have Windows less than version 10,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you can use something called putty.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Putty will exceed the exact same thing as SSH.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So when I say you should SSH, if you're on Windows,

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
you can use putty.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And putty is valid for any version of Windows.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They do the exact same thing, they allow you to

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
use the SSH protocol to connect into your EC2 instances.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And then finally, there's something new

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
called the EC2 Instance Connect,

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is going to use your web browser.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So not a terminal nut putty your web browser

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to connect to your EC2 instance.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And I like it a lot because it is valid

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
for Mac, Linux, Windows, all versions.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The cool thing about EC2 Instance Connect is that it works,

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but it only works for now with Amazon NX2

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And this is why I've been using

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Amazon NX2 in this tutorial.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So now what should you do?

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If you are on Mac or Linux,

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
then please watch the SSH lecture on Mac/Linux.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you're on Windows,

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
then you can either watch the Putty Lecture

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
or if you have Windows 10, then I have created an SSH

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
on Windows 10 lecture as well.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Regardless, I am going to personally use

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in the future lectures, EC2 Instance Connect.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So if you wanna have a look and play with it,

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I find it really simple.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You don't need to install anything

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
or use the command line interface

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
if you're not familiar with it.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So this could be very handy for all of you.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Nonetheless, SSH is in my experience

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and I've taught hundreds of thousands of students

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
what caused the most troubles in this course.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So if you get a problem with SSH

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we can re-watch the lecture, you may have missed something,

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
maybe a security group rule, maybe you command,

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
maybe a typo, I don't know you.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There's also a troubleshooting guide

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
that I've put together after these lectures so have a look.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I would recommend your try, EC2 Instance Connect

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
as well as sometimes fixes all problems.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And if none of these method works, sorry

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
if one method works, then you're good to go.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You don't need to have them all working.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If one works, you're good to go.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And if no method works, that's completely okay.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This course is just introductory

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and he won't use SSH much and you'll be fine.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So that's it that just for the introduction.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now find your right lecture and it will see you

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
in the next lecture.
