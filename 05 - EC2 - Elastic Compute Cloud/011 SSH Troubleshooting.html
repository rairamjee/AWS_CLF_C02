<h4><strong>SSH&nbsp;Troubleshooting</strong></h4><p><br></p><blockquote><p><strong>1) There's a connection timeout</strong></p></blockquote><p>This is a security group issue. Any timeout (not just for SSH) is related to security groups or a firewall. Ensure your security group looks like this and correctly assigned to your EC2 instance. </p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2019-10-23_14-53-48-cc1a033599952b0c25e1932ddfe1eb46.png"></figure><blockquote><p><strong>2)&nbsp;There's still a connection timeout issue</strong></p></blockquote><p>If your security group is properly configured as above, and you still have connection timeout issues, then that means a corporate firewall or a personal firewall is blocking the connection. <strong>Please use EC2 Instance Connect as described in the next lecture.</strong></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><strong>3) SSH&nbsp;does not work on Windows</strong></p></blockquote><ul><li><p>If it says: <code>ssh command not found</code>, that means you have to use Putty</p></li><li><p>Follow again the video. If things don't work, please use EC2 Instance Connect as described in the next lecture</p></li></ul><p><br></p><blockquote><p><strong>4)&nbsp;There's a connection refused</strong></p></blockquote><p>This means the instance is reachable, but no SSH&nbsp;utility is running on the instance</p><ul><li><p>Try to restart the instance</p></li><li><p>If it doesn't work, terminate the instance and create a new one. Make sure you're using <strong>Amazon Linux 2</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><blockquote><p><strong>5)&nbsp; </strong><code><strong>Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)</strong></code></p></blockquote><p>This means either two things:</p><ul><li><p>You are using the wrong security key or not using a security key. Please look at your EC2 instance configuration to make sure you have assigned the correct key to it. </p></li><li><p>You are using the wrong user. Make sure you have started an <strong>Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance</strong>, and make sure you're using the user <strong>ec2-user. </strong>This is something you specify when doing <code><strong>ec2-user@</strong>&lt;public-ip&gt;</code> (ex:&nbsp;<code>ec2-user@35.180.242.162</code>) in your SSH&nbsp;command or your Putty configuration</p></li></ul><p><br></p><blockquote><p><strong>6) Nothing is working - "aaaahhhhhh"</strong></p></blockquote><p>Don't panic. Use <strong>EC2 Instance Connect</strong> from the next lecture. Make sure you started an <strong>Amazon Linux 2</strong> and you will be able to follow along with the tutorial :)</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><strong>7)&nbsp;I was able to connect yesterday, but today I can't</strong></p></blockquote><p>This is probably because you have stopped your EC2 instance and then started it again today. <strong>When you do so, the public IP&nbsp;of your EC2 instance will change.</strong> Therefore, in your command, or Putty configuration, please make sure to edit and save the new public IP.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Happy troubleshooting!</strong><br>Stephane</p>
