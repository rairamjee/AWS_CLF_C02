1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I want to show you an alternative to SSH

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
that I found a lot easier

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is the EC2 Instance Connect.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So for this, you click on My First Instance

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and then you click on the top, it says connect.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You have multiple options including

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the SSH client we saw from before.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But one option I wanna show you is the EC2 Instance Connect.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So this allows us to do a browser based SSH session

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
into our EC2 Instance.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For this we verified the public IP address, which is good.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The username is provided by default,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which is EC2 user because it get guessed

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
by AWS that we are using Amazon and X2

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and therefore EC2 User is the right username,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but if you wanted to, you could override it,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but it doesn't work unless you enter EC2 users.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So we'll leave it as is for now,

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and then, as you see there's no SSH key option,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
because, well, when we do connect to it,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
it's going to upload for us a temporary SSH key

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and establish a connection this way.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So with this methodology,

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
we don't even need to manage SSH keys which I found lovely.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So you click on Connect and it's going to open a new tab.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And very quickly you are into your Amazon Linux 2 AMI

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and you can start running some commands

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
such as whoami or ping google.com.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And as you can see, everything is working.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So the cool thing about it is that,

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
well, your session is in the browser

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
instead of using a different command line interface

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
such as terminal and so on.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And so you do ping google.com or do

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
any kind of commands you want really on it

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
without using the SSH utility beforehand.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But in this course, if I say use SSH,

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you have either the option to use your own terminal mssh

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
or to use for example, party, or to use the SSH command

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
on windows or to use, regardless of you here

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
on windows, Linux, or Mac, the EC2 Instance Connect.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now this is relying on the SSH behind the scenes.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So if I go, for example, to my Instance

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
look at the security group and I want to edit the rules.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So I click on my security group in here,

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
the inbound rules I'm going to edit them

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and I'm going to remove the SSH inbound rules.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So I delete it and save the rules

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and then go back to my EC2 Instances,

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and I close this one and I'll try to establish

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
a new EC2 Instance Connect.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So let's connect, as you can see, this is not working

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
because while there's a problem connected to your Instance.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The first thing is that you need to open the port 22.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So back into my launch wizard, I can fix this.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I will edit the inbound rule, add the SSH rule

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
from anywhere IPV4, save the rule.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's go back in here and just in case,

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
if it doesn't work for you,

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
sometimes it's because you're using IPV6, excuse me.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So therefore you need to do from anywhere IPV6 as well.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So you need to add these two entries

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
for your EC2 Instance Connect

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
to work sometimes, depends on your setup.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So we're good to go.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And now if we try to connect to the Instance itself,

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so let's try to connect in here.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Voila, we are into the Instance.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So there was a quick demo of EC2 Instance Connect.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I will use it a lot in this course.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
