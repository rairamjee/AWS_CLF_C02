1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So we are going to learn how

3
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
to SSH into our EC2 Instance using Windows.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And for this, we used to say, what is SSH?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, SSH to me is one of the most important function,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
especially when you deal with Amazon cloud.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It will basically allow you to control a machine remotely

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
all using the command line.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And so what does it look like?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, basically we have our EC2 machine,

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and it's running Amazon Linux 2, and it has a public IP.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And I don't know if you remember,

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but we had an SSH security group on it.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And basically we allowed SSH on port 22 to any IP,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which basically allows our Windows machine to connect

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
over the internet directly into the machine

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and control it using the command line.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So we'll see how to do the requirements for parameterizing

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
basically our Windows.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And so we'll use PuTTY to do SSH.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So this is a free tool available online.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And as you can see,

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
it's a little bit tricky to use the first time,

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
but we'll get used to it,

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and we'll learn how to SSH into Windows,

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
into Linux using PuTTY.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So let's get started.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So we are going to SSH

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
into our EC2 Instance and I'm running on Windows.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And for this, I assume that you have Windows 7,

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
or Windows 8, or an older version Window.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you have Windows 10,

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
there is an alternative in the next lecture, both work.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So let's try for, even if you're on Windows 10

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
you can do this technique.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So for this, you would go and download PuTTY.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So PuTTY is a free SSH client for Windows.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So download PuTTY.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And then I will choose, for example,

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the 64 bits installer, the first one.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Then I go ahead.

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I perform the install of PuTTY.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So next, next, yes.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And yes, I want to install PuTTY.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Perfect.

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So PuTTY is installed.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I have to install PuTTY.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So, we have two things here on PuTTY.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We have the PuTTY app, as well as PuTTYgen.

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So let's first open PuTTYgen.

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And in case you did not download your file

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
in the PPK format, you can actually generate the PPK format

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
directly from here.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So let me show you how it's done.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, I need to go ahead and load my file.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So I click on load, and then find where my file is.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So for me, it's on my desktop.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And you can see, I see nothing,

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but if I go to the bottom right, and show all files

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I will find my EC2 tutorial in the PEM format.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So I can select it.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It says, okay, you have successfully imported this.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And then you can save it as a private key.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So click on save private key.

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And said you wanna have a pathways, you say,

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
if you don't wanna have path, you say yes.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And then you save it on your desktop.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So EC2tutorial.PPK

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now your file is saved

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and you have converted successfully

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
a PEM file into the PPK format.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you have done this already, then you're good to go.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Next, we need to set up PuTTY

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to access our EC2 Instance.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So, this time you open the PuTTY app,

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and here we have to enter a host name

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
or an IP address of where we are trying to connect.

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So this we know it's My First Instance.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You copy the public IPv4 address.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You paste it.

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And it's SSH.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're going to save this under EC2 Instance.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And then you click on save, but we're not done just yet.

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We need to specify the key itself.

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So let's specify the key in here.

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So, you have it saved under EC2 Instance.

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I double clicked.

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So as you can see, I have to accept this.

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So if we accept because we trust the host,

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
we say, yes, accept.

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But we still have the login as prompt and it will not work.

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So if I do, for example, EC2 user, it says okay,

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I cannot authenticate right now.

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So for this, we go back into PuTTY,

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and we're going to fix things.

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So click on EC2 Instance and load this profile.

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The first thing I'm going to add is in the host name.

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have EC2 minus user at the IP.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So the IP is where we access our server,

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and the EC2 user is a user already created for us

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
on Amazon Linux 2.

106
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So I can click on save again.

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So we're done in here.

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This will be saved.

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then for the key, we need to go into the SSH.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You click the plus, you have the Auth,

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you click the plus, excuse me, no need to click the plus.

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So you just click on Auth,

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and then you need to find a private key file

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
for authentication.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Click on browse, go to your desktop.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And then you find the EC2 tutorial, that PPK file,

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
you have just generated using Puttygen.

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Or, if you had downloaded it already

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
from the AWS console, that works as well.

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So this file is good.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't click on open just yet, go back to session,

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and then click on save, to save this profile.

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This way you don't have to redo all these steps

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
all at once, over again.

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So click on open.

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And now it says, okay, you're authenticating

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
using the EC2 user.

128
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And we have this file we just opened.

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And so now we are into our Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

130
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So we have successfully performed the SSH using PuTTY.

131
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So if in the course I refer to SSH, just for you,

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
just that means you should PuTTY into the Instance,

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
at least once.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And now what I can do, who am I?

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And you find that I am EC2 user.

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Or ping google.com and start running some commands.

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So to stop this,

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
just do control C, and it will stop the command.

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And then if you want to just exit this,

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
you can just close this, exit this session,

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and you're good to go.

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And let's check if you go back into PuTTY.

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So click back on PuTTY, and you load the EC2 Instance.

145
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hopefully all you're seeing there is save.

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So as you can see, the top settings are saved,

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and my SSH Auth also has saved.

148
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And therefore, if I click on open, then yes,

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I have access directly into my EC2 Instance.

150
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So we've successfully performed SSH

151
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
on this Windows 7 or Windows 8, through PuTTY.

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And I will see you in the next lecture

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
in case you have Windows 10,

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
to show you how to SSH using Windows.
