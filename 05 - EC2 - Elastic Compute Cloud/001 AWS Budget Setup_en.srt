1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So, we are going to make sure

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
to set up a budget and an alarm for that budget

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
for this course in order for us

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
not to spend any money or too much money.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, therefore we need to go into the billing console.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, you can click on the top right of your screen

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and then click on Billing and Cost Management.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, as you can see here, I get a lot of access denied.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is because I'm logged in as an IAM user, Stephane,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
from my accounts.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And I had administrative access,

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but even though I have administrative access,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I cannot access my billing data.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So to fix this, you can go into your root account.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So here, I'm in my root account as you can see.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It just says the name of my account.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It doesn't say IAM user.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And then, you click on it and you go to Accounts.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So from Accounts, you're going to scroll down.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And then scrolling down, you will find the IAM user

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and role access to billing information.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
As you can see right now it is deactivated.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, we need to just activate IAM access

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and this will allow IAM users to access

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the billing information if they are administrators.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So back into my billing console now,

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and I refresh this page.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And I refresh again and it can take a bit of time.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
As you can see now, I see my data.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, except this for the forecast

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
because there is a data unavailable exception,

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
so insufficient amount of historical data.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Except for this, we can see all my cost information in here.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, now let me show you what a billing page looks like

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
for an account that I'm actually using and have some costs.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So as we can see, we get some information

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
around the month-to-date's cost.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We get the total forecasted cost

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
for the current month and so on,

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and last month's total cost.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, from this we can get a few information

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
such as the cost breakdown by month.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So, this is when you start seeing some cost.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And then we can have a look at bills.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So if you look at bills,

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
say you have any cost for this tutorial.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
For this course, let's go into December, 2023.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So you will find at the bottom of it, charges by service.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And so you'll see the number of active services.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Right now I have 28.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And for example,

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
if I look at the Elastic Compute Cloud, so EC2,

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I see I have $43 of cost in EU Ireland.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And it turns out that here is the breakdown of my cost.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So, there is some Amazon Elastic Compute NatGateway,

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
which is costing me $35.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And there is some EBS cost,

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
there is some Elastic IP cost, and so on.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And so you can get a lot of information

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
out of just this bill.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, in case you see any kind of cost for your accounts,

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
remember to go into bills,

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
go to the month you're interested into,

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and then scroll down to get charged by service

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
where you're going to get a lot of information

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
around how every service is being used,

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and how you are billed for service,

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which will allow you to break down your bill very easily.

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Next, you can go into free tier on the left hand side.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, AWs does have a free tier.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And you're going to be able to see the current usage

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and the forecasted usage,

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
as well as again, what the free tier is.

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And then you will see whether or not

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
you're going to pass the free tier usage.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So if you do pass it as a forecast, it goes into the red,

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
then you are going to be billed,

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
so make sure you turn off anything that is turned on

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and potentially costing you money.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, this is a very, very helpful dashboard.

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, so now let's go ahead and set up a budget.

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So, on the left hand side you click on Budgets.

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And here you can create a budget that will alert you

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
whenever you reach your thresholds.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So, let's create a budget.

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And we're going to use a template simplified.

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And the first one is going to be a zero spend budget.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So as soon as we reach 1 cent, we're going to get an alert.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So this is very helpful.

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, the budget name is My Zero Spend Budget.

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Here you add your email.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So, I put here stephane@example.com

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and then create the budget.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So whenever I will spend 1 cent,

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I will have this budget send me an email.

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You can also use another template for a monthly cost budget.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And here we're saying, "Okay, we want to have

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
a monthly cost budget of, for example, $10."

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And saying, "Hey, I want to spend

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
no more than $10 per month on this course."

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And then, the email recipients

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
are going to be again, stephane@example.com.

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And by the way, if you follow this course closely,

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you should not spend any dollars as you,

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
when things can cost you money.

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But if you're careful, you should not spend any money.

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Regardless, it's still good to set up a budget

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
just to make sure in case you do mistakes

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
that you don't have a big bill coming to your way.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So now for this $10 budget,

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm actually going to reach an email

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
when my actual spend reaches 85% and my,

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
when my actual spend is going to reach 100%.

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And if my forecasted spend is expected to also reach 100%.

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, very helpful.

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can have three emails I can receive from this.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And I'm going to create this budget.

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So as you can see,

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
while my zero spend budget has already been exceeded,

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
because while I've spent some money this month,

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
so I'm getting an email right away at this address.

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, with these budgets and access to the free tier

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
on the left hand side to explore,

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
as well as accessing your bills breakdown

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
on the left hand side,

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
you should be able to debug any kind of costing issue

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and billing issue you have on this course.

128
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And this is a skill that is going to be necessary

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
for you when using AWS.

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
All right, so that's it for this lecture.

131
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I hope you liked it.

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
