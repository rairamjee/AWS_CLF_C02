1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Been on EC2

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
in which we will create our first website on AWS.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So what is Amazon EC2?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS' offering.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It is definitely used everywhere.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And what is it?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, it stands for Elastic Compute Cloud

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and this is the way to do Infrastructure as a Service

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
on AWS.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So EC2 is not just one service.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's composed of many things at a high level.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So you can rent virtual machines on EC2,

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
they're called EC2 instances.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You can store data on virtual drives or EBS volumes.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You can distribute load across machines,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Elastic Load Balancer.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You can scale services using an auto-scaling group or ASG,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and all these things, do not worry,

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we will see in depth during this course.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Knowing how to use EC2 in AWS is fundamental

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to understand how the cloud works.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Because as I said from before,

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the cloud is to be able to rent these compute

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
whenever you need, on demand, and EC2 is just that.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, EC2, what can we choose for our instances

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
so there're virtual server that were rent from AWS?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So what Operating System can we choose

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
for our EC2 instances?

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Three options:

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Linux, and it's going to be the most popular,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Windows or even Mac OS.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How much compute power and cores you want

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
on this virtual machine?

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So how much CPU?

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Then you need to choose how much random access memory

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
or RAM you want,

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and how much storage space.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So for example,

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
do you want storage that is going to be attached

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
through the network

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and we'll see about it with EBS or EFS,

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
or do you want it to be hardware attached?

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In this case, it will be an EC2 instance store.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And we have a whole section on storage,

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
so don't worry about it.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And then finally,

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the type of network you want to attach to your EC2 instance.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, do you want a network card that is going to be fast?

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What kind of public IP do you want?

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And finally, we need to handle the firewall rules

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
of our EC2 instance, and that is the security group.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I live, finally, finally,

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
there's the Bootstrap script to configure the instance

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
at first launch, which is called the EC2 User Data.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So we have lots and lots of options

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and as you'll see in the hands-on,

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
even more options at other certification levels

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
that you need to know in EC2 instances,

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but at a core of it what you need to remember is that

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
you can choose pretty much how you want your visual machine

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
to be and you can rent it from AWS.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And that is the power of the cloud.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can do this by just in the blink of the eye, really.

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So it is possible to bootstrap our instances

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
using the EC2 User Data script.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So what does bootstrapping mean?

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, bootstrapping means launching commands when

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
the machine starts.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, that script is only run once and when it first starts,

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and then will never be run again.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So the EC2 User Data has a very specific purpose.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It is to automate boot tasks, hence the name bootstrapping.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So what tasks do you want to automate?

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Usually, when you boot your instance

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
while you want to install updates, install software,

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
download common files from the Internet,

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
or anything you can think of really,

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
anything you can think of.

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So it could be whatever you want,

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but just know that

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
the more you add into your User Data script,

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the more your instant has to do at boot time.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Simple, right?

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
By the way,

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the EC2 User Data scripts runs with a root user.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So any command you have will have the pseudo rights.

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay?

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What type of instances do we get for EC2?

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And this is an example.

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have hundreds and hundreds of EC2 instance types,

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
but, here are five for you.

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So the first one is a t2 micro, very very simple.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It has one vCPU, one gigabyte of memory.

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The storage is only for EBS,

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and it has a low to moderate network performance.

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But as soon as you increase the instance type

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
like for example if you stay in the same family,

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
so we stay in the t2 family but we go to t2.xlarge,

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
now we have access to four vCPU

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
16 megabytes of RAM,

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
gigabytes of RAM, sorry,

102
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and network performance of moderate.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If we go to complete different new levels,

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
so c5d.4xlarge, which is a very complicated name,

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you get 16 vCPU, so 16 cores,

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you get 32 gigabytes of memory, so a lot more,

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
you get some storage that is attached to your EC2 instance,

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
this is where it says 400 NVMe SSD.

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now the network is going to get really good

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
up to 10 gigabytes,

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
as well as the bandwidth to talk to network storage.

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And so, as you can see,

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
if you go to r5.16xlarge or m5.8xlarge,

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
again you have different characteristics.

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So, the idea with this is that

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
you choose the kind of instance that fits best

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
your application,

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and you can use that on the cloud on demand.

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay?

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now, for this instance, for our course,

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
t2 micro is going to be part of the AWS free tier.

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can get up to 750 hours per month of t2 micro

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
which represents basically running that instance

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
continuously for a month.

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And so this is what we'll be using in the hands-on

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
that comes in the next lecture.

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So this was a short introduction to EC2.

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Don't worry, it's going to get very very practical

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
very soon.

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will see you in the next lecture.
