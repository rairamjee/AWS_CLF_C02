1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay. So let's practice using IAM roles

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
for our EC2 Instance.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So at first, I'm going to connect to my EC2 Instance.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You can SSH, or you can use EC2 Instance Connect

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
if you wanted to.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I will use EC2 Instance Connect

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
because it's just going to be in my web browser

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and a little bit simpler.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So back into my instance

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
with EC2 Instance Connect right here.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And we are in our Instance.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So as we can see,

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we are ec2-user@ and the private IP.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So regardless if you're using EC2 Instance Connects

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
or SSH through your terminal, or whatever,

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
through PuTTY.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then if you see this, we are at the same stage, okay?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So now you can just do some Linux commands.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
For example, ping Google,

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and you can get some information out of Google.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And I will do Control + C to go out of it

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
or issue any kind of Linux commands you want.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, you don't need to know the next command

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
going into the exam,

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but this is just a Linux terminal available

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to you right now in the cloud.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So we'll type clear to clear the screen

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and next we have to run some IAM commands.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So the cool thing is that's the Amazon Linux AMI

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
we're using right now comes with the aid of a CLI.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And so, as you can see, it is installed.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So what we can do is start using some commands.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
For example, aws iam list users.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And if we do so, it says unable to look at credentials.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can configure credentials by using aws configure.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So we could indeed run aws configure

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to configure the credentials and specify an Access ID

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
a Secret Access key, and a region name.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But this is a really, really, really bad idea.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And the reason is that if we run aws configure

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and enter our personal details onto this EC2 Instance,

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
then anyone else in our accounts

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
could again connect to our EC2 Instance.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
For example, using EC2 Instance Connect

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and retrieve the value of these credentials in our instance,

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
which is not what we want.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is something that's really, really bad.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And so as a rule of thumb, never, ever, ever

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
enter your IAM APA key.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So the Access Key ID and the Secret Access key

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
into an EC2 Instance.

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is horrible and if you see someone doing it,

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
please show them this video.

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Instead, what we have to do is use IAM rules.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So if you remember,

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
when we were in the management console and we were in IAM,

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
we had created an IAM role.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So let's go back into the Roles.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We had this demo role for EC2

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
that had one policy attached called IAMReadOnlyAccess.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So we are going to attach this role

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
onto our EC2 Instance to provide it with credentials.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, so how do we do this?

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
For this, we can go into Security.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And as you can see,

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
there is no IAM Role right now onto our instance.

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So what we can do is go back to our Instances,

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Action, Security, and then Modify IAM role.

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Here we have to choose an IAM role.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So we have DemoRoleForEC2 and click on Save

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
to attach this IAM role into our Instance.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So if you go back to Security,

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
now the IAM role attached to Instance

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
DemoRoleForEC2.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So the effect of this is that now

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
if we do aws iam list users and press Enter,

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
where we are getting a response around the users from IAM.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So as we can see, we did not run the command aws configure.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We just attached an IAM role and ran this command.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And it works.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And as a proof, if we go into this role

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and detach this permission, so now it's gone,

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and run the command again, we're getting an access denied.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So the role is really linked now to the EC2 Instance.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And this is how we provide AWS credentials

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
to our EC2 Instances only,

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
only through IAM roles, okay?

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So if we go back to IAM

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and we attach a policy to this role

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and go back to IAMReadOnlyAccess,

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
attach this policy and then rerun the command,

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
we get an access denied

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
because sometimes it can take a little bit of time

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
to propagate the changes from IAM into AWS.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But if we run it one more time,

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we're getting the output we expect,

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
which is what we want.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So this is very important

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
for you to understand this,

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
use IAM roles for your EC2 Instances.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So this is hopefully good for you.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I hope you like this hands-on

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
